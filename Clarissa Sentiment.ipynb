      "Clarissa sends down proposals in writing to her friends, and a letter to her brother.\n",
      "Her sister's cruel insults on the occasion produce another warm dialogue between them.\n",
      "I am extremely concerned, my dearest friend, for the disturbances that have happened in your family.\n",
      "I know how it must hurt you to become the subject of the public talk: and yet, upon an occasion so generally known, it is impossible but that whatever relates to a young lady, whose distinguished merits have made her the public care, should engage every body's attention.\n",
      "There are people who love not your brother, because of his natural imperiousness and fierce and uncontroulable temper: these say, that the young gentleman's passion was abated on seeing his blood gush plentifully down his arm; and that he received the generous offices of his adversary (who helped him off with his coat and waistcoat, and bound up his arm, till the surgeon could come,) with such patience, as was far from making a visit afterwards from that adversary, to inquire after his health, appear either insulting or improper.\n",
      "As all your friends without doors are apprehensive that some other unhappy event may result from so violent a contention, in which it seems the families on both sides are now engaged, I must desire you to enable me, on the authority of your own information, to do you occasional justice.\n",
      "Every individual of it who knows you, or has heard of you, seems to think you answerable to her for your conduct in points so very delicate and concerning.\n",
      "Thus, however, could my sister make it out—'Upon her word, she believed Mr. Lovelace deserved not the bad character he had as to women.—He was really, to her thinking, a modest man.\n",
      "'What did the man mean, she wondered?\n",
      "And it was agreed upon between my aunt Hervey and her, that she was to be quite solemn and shy in his next visit, if there were not a peculiarity in his address to her.\n",
      "This was not the way, as it proved, to be taken for matters of mere omission, with a man of Mr. Lovelace's penetration.\n",
      "Then my poor sister is not naturally good-humoured.\n",
      "Yet he thought fit to put the question too:—But, she says, it was not till, by some means or other (she knew not how) he had wrought her up to such a pitch of displeasure with him, that it was impossible for her to recover herself at the instant.\n",
      "Here I am obliged to lay down my pen.\n",
      "He sighed, as Bella told us, when he took his leave of her: 'Profoundly sighed; grasped her hand, and kissed it with such an ardour—Withdrew with such an air of solemn respect—She could almost find it in her heart, although he had vexed her, to pity him.'\n",
      "But Mr. Lovelace going up directly to town, where he staid a whole fortnight, and meeting there with my uncle Antony, to whom he regretted his niece's cruel resolution not to change her state; it was seen that there was a total end of the affair.\n",
      "But when Mr. Lovelace returned into the country, he thought fit to visit my father and mother; hoping, as he told them, that, however unhappy he had been in the rejection of the wished-for alliance, he might be allowed to keep up an acquaintance and friendship with a family which he should always respect.\n",
      "And then unhappily, as I may say, was I at home and present.\n",
      "These particulars I had partly from my aunt Hervey, and partly from my sister; for I was called out as soon as the subject was entered upon.\n",
      "A case too common in considerable families where there is an only son: and his mother never had any other child.\n",
      "My sister allowed that the man had a tolerable knack of writing and describing: And my father, who had been abroad in his youth, said, that his remarks were curious, and shewed him to be a person of reading, judgment and taste.\n",
      "You can't imagine how saucily the man looked; as if, in short, he was disappointed that he had not made a more sensible impression upon me: nor, when he recollected himself (as he did immediately), what a visible struggle it cost him to change his haughty airs for more placid ones.\n",
      "He justified his avowed inveteracy by common fame, and by what he had known of him at college; declaring, that he had ever hated him; ever should hate him; and would never own him for a brother, or me for a sister, if I married him.\n",
      "He found my sister, who waited but for the occasion, ready to join him in his resentments against the man he hated.\n",
      "She utterly disclaimed all manner of regard for him: 'Never liked him at all:—His estate was certainly much incumbered: it was impossible it should be otherwise; so entirely devoted as he was to his pleasures.\n",
      "And then did she boast of, and my brother praised her for, refusing him: and both joined on all occasions to depreciate him, and not seldom made the occasions; their displeasure against him causing every subject to run into this, if it began not with it.\n",
      "I was not solicitous to vindicate him when I was not joined in their reflection.\n",
      "But this only subjected me to reproach, as having a prepossession in his favour which I would not own.—So that, when I could not change the subject, I used to retire either to my music, or to my closet.\n",
      "Their behaviour to him, when they could not help seeing him, was very cold and disobliging; but as yet not directly affrontive.\n",
      "And at last they gave such a loose to their passions, all of a sudden* as I may say, that instead of withdrawing, as they used to do when he came, they threw themselves in his way purposely to affront him.\n",
      "Mr. Lovelace, you may believe, very ill brooked this: but nevertheless contented himself to complain of it to me: in high terms, however, telling me, that but for my sake my brother's treatment of him was not to be borne.\n",
      "'He was a sad gentleman, he said, as to women:—If his tenants had pretty daughters, they chose to keep them out of his sight.\n",
      "He believed he kept no particular mistress; for he had heard newelty, that was the man's word, was every thing with him.\n",
      "This was his character from an enemy; for, as my aunt observed, every thing the man said commendably of him came grudgingly, with a must needs say—to do him justice, &c. while the contrary was delivered with a free good-will.\n",
      "And this character, as a worse was expected, though this was bad enough, not answering the end of inquiring after it, my brother and sister were more apprehensive than before, that his address would be encouraged, since the worst part of it was known, or supposed, when he was first introduced to my sister.\n",
      "But Mr. Lovelace is a man not easily brought to give up his purpose, especially in a point wherein he pretends his heart is so much engaged: and no absolute prohibition having been given, things went on for a little while as before: for I saw plainly, that to have denied myself to his visits (which however I declined receiving as often as I could) was to bring forward some desperate issue between the two; since the offence so readily given on one side was brooked by the other only out of consideration to me.\n",
      "And thus did my brother's rashness lay me under an obligation where I would least have owed it.\n",
      "The intermediate proposals of Mr. Symmes and Mr. Mullins, both (in turn) encouraged by my brother, induced him to be more patient for a while, as nobody thought me over-forward in Mr. Lovelace's favour; for he hoped that he should engage my father and uncles to approve of the one or the other in opposition to the man he hated.\n",
      "But when he found that I had interest enough to disengage myself from the addresses of those gentlemen, as I had (before he went to Scotland, and before Mr. Lovelace visited here) of Mr. Wyerley's, he then kept no measures: and first set himself to upbraid me for supposed prepossession, which he treated as if it were criminal; and then to insult Mr. Lovelace in person, at Mr. Edward Symmes's, the brother of the other Symmes, two miles off; and no good Dr. Lewen being there to interpose, the unhappy rencounter followed.\n",
      "My brother was disarmed, as you have heard; and on being brought home, and giving us ground to suppose he was much worse hurt than he really was, and a fever ensuing, every one flamed out; and all was laid at my door.\n",
      "Mr. Lovelace for three days together sent twice each day to inquire after my brother's health; and although he received rude and even shocking returns, he thought fit on the fourth day to make in person the same inquiries; and received still greater incivilities from my two uncles, who happened to be both there.\n",
      "I fainted away with terror, seeing every one so violent, and hearing Mr. Lovelace swear that he would not depart till he had made my uncles ask his pardon for the indignities he had received at their hands; a door being held fast locked between him and them.\n",
      "But when Mr. Lovelace was told how ill I was, he departed; nevertheless vowing revenge.\n",
      "To this unhappy necessity was owing our renewed correspondence, as I may call it; yet I did not write till I had informed myself from Mr. Symmes's brother, that he was really insulted into the act of drawing his sword by my brother's repeatedly threatening (upon his excusing himself out of regard to me) to brand me ir he did not; and, by all the inquiry I could make, that he was again the sufferer from my uncles in a more violent manner than I have related.\n",
      "The same circumstances were related to my father and other relations by Mr. Symmes; but they had gone too far in making themselves parties to the quarrel either to retract or forgive; and I was forbidden to correspond with him, or to be seen a moment in his company.\n",
      "Mean time, I cannot help saying, that I am exceedingly concerned to find, that I am become so much the public talk as you tell me I am.\n",

      "Our sex perhaps must expect to bear a little—uncourtliness shall I call it?—from the husband whom as the lover they let know the preference their hearts gave him to all other men.—Say what they will of generosity being a manly virtue; but upon my word, my dear, I have ever yet observed, that it is not to be met with in that sex one time in ten that it is to be found in ours.—But my father was soured by the cruel distemper I have named; which seized him all at once in the very prime of life, in so violent a manner as to take from the most active of minds, as his was, all power of activity, and that in all appearance for life.—It imprisoned, as I may say, his lively spirits in himself, and turned the edge of them against his own peace; his extraordinary prosperity adding to his impatiency.\n",
      "What excuse can be made for his haughty and morose temper?\n",
      "But no more of this.\n",

      "And if Mr. Lovelace should follow me, things might be worse than they are now.\n",

      "Will you engage, my dear, that the hated man shall not come near your house?—But what an inconsistence is this, when they consent to my going, thinking his visits here no otherwise to be avoided!—But if he does come, I charge you never to leave us alone together.\n",

      "And well might they apprehend so:—For who do you think he is?—No other than that Solmes—Could you have believed it?—And they are all determined too; my mother with the rest!—Dear, dear excellence!\n",
      "I was struck all of a heap as soon as I entered, to see a solemnity which I had been so little used to on the like occasions in the countenance of every dear relation.\n",
      "I ran to my father, and kneeled: then to my mother: and met from both a cold salute: From my father a blessing but half pronounced: My mother indeed called me child; but embraced me not with her usual indulgent ardour.\n",
      "After I had paid my duty to my uncles, and my compliments to my sister, which she received with solemn and stiff form, I was bid to sit down.\n",
      "But my heart was full: and I said it became me to stand, if I could stand, upon a reception so awful and unusual.\n",
      "I was forced to turn my face from them, and pull out my handkerchief.\n",
      "My unbrotherly accuser hereupon stood forth, and charged me with having received no less than five or six visits at Miss Howe's from the man they had all so much reason to hate [that was the expression]; notwithstanding the commands I had had to the contrary.\n",
      "I proceeded, that I had reason to believe, that both Mrs. Howe and Miss, as matters stood, would much rather have excused his visits; but they had more than once apologized, that having not the same reason my papa had to forbid him their house, his rank and fortune entitled him to civility.\n",
      "I hoped, I said, there was no harm done: that it became not me to prescribe to Mrs. or Miss Howe who should be their visitors: that Mrs. Howe was always diverted with the raillery that passed between Miss and him: that I had no reason to challenge her guest for my visitor, as I should seem to have done had I refused to go into their company when he was with them: that I had never seen him out of the presence of one or both of those ladies; and had signified to him once, on his urging a few moments' private conversation with me, that, unless a reconciliation were effected between my family and his, he must not expect that I would countenance his visits, much less give him an opportunity of that sort.\n",
      "The poor Bella has, you know, a plump high-fed face, if I may be allowed the expression.\n",
      "My father, with vehemence both of action and voice [my father has, you know, a terrible voice when he is angry] told me that I had met with too much indulgence in being allowed to refuse this gentleman, and the other gentleman,; and it was now his turn to be obeyed!\n",
      "I went up to my chamber, and there with my faithful Hannah deplored the determined face which the new proposal it was plain they had to make me wore.\n",
      "I had not recovered myself when I was sent for down to tea.\n",
      "At him, when I could glance at him, with disgust little short of affrightment.\n",
      "How difficult is it, my dear, to give a negative where both duty and inclination join to make one wish to oblige!\n",
      "He has but a very ordinary share of understanding; is very illiterate; knows nothing but the value of estates, and how to improve them, and what belongs to land-jobbing and husbandry.\n",
      "Yet I am as one stupid, I think.\n",
      "They have begun so cruelly with me, that I have not spirit enough to assert my own negative.\n",
      "Mean time it has been signified to me, that it will be acceptable if I do not think of going to church next Sunday.\n",

      "I have had the expected conference with my aunt.\n",
      "I hate him more than before.\n",
      "What then is this narrow selfishness that reigns in us, but relationship remembered against relationship forgot?\n",
      "I know my duty, said I; and hope I shall not find impossible condition annexed to it.\n",

      "My father sat half-aside in his elbow-chair, that his head might be turned from me: his hands clasped, and waving, as it were, up and down; his fingers, poor dear gentleman!\n",
      "in motion, as if angry to the very ends of them.\n",
      "He looked so very sternly, that my heart failed me as twice or thrice I would have addressed myself to him: nothing but solemn silence on all hands having passed before.\n",
      "He answered me with the same angry monosyllable, which I had received from my mother before; and then arose, and walked about the room.\n",
      "Let me beseech you, my dear and ever-honoured Papa, (and I dropt down on my knees,) that I may have only yours and my mamma's will, and not my brother's, to obey.\n",

      "One corner of this being separated off for the roosting-place of my little poultry, either she or I shall never want a pretence to go thither.\n",
      "Determined as I think I am, and cannot help it, I would at least give a patient hearing to what may be said on the other side.\n",

      "He complained of spies set upon his conduct, and to pry into his life and morals, and this by your brother and uncles.\n",
      "and V.\n",

      "In those letters, of which I have kept memorandums, I gave you an account of my brother's and sister's antipathy to Mr. Lovelace; and the methods they took (so far as they had then come to my knowledge) to ruin him in the opinion of my other friends.\n",
      "And I told you, that after a very cold, yet not a directly affrontive behaviour to him, they all of a sudden* became more violent, and proceeded to personal insults; which brought on at last the unhappy rencounter between my brother and him.\n",
      "Nothing less would satisfy his ambition.\n",
      "'whereas daughters are chickens brought up for tables of other men.'\n",
      "My brother then returned; and we were all wrong again: and Bella, as I observed in my letters abovementioned, had an opportunity to give herself the credit of having refused Mr. Lovelace, on the score of his reputed faulty morals.\n",
      "Nor did it appear, that he was so bad a man as he had been represented to be: wild indeed; but it was a gay time of life: he was a man of sense: and he was sure that his niece would not have him, if she had not good reason to think him reformed, or that there was a likelihood that she could reform him by her example.'\n",
      "An unhappy tenant of my uncle Antony came petitioning to my uncle for forbearance, in Mr. Lovelace's presence.\n",
      "He asked him how long it would take him to retrieve the foolish step he acknowledged he had made.\n",
      "He had from early days, by his violent temper, made himself both feared and courted by the whole family.\n",
      "From this time (as I now find it plain upon recollection) did my brother and sister behave to me, as to one who stood in their way; and to each other as having but one interest: and were resolved, therefore, to bend all their force to hinder an alliance from taking effect, which they believed was likely to oblige them to contract their views.\n",
      "Mean time, orders are given to all the servants to shew the highest respect to Mr. Solmes; the generous Mr. Solmes is now his character with some of our family!\n",
      "But were there no other motive to induce me to despise the upstart man, is not this unjust one to his family enough?—The upstart man, I repeat; for he was not born to the immense riches he is possessed of: riches left by one niggard to another, in injury to the next heir, because that other is a niggard.\n",
      "My BROTHER and my SISTER triumph.—They have got me down, as Hannah overheard them exult.\n",
      "They do indeed value her: but, I am sorry to say, she has purchased that value by her compliances; yet has merit for which she ought to be venerated; prudence which ought of itself to be conformed to in every thing.\n",
      "Yet I must oppose it (to comply is impossible); and must without delay declare my opposition, or my difficulties will increase; since, as I am just now informed, a lawyer has been this very day consulted [Would you have believed it?]\n",
      "By what remote, exceedingly remote views!\n",
      "On Hannah's depositing my long letter, (begun yesterday, but by reason of several interruptions not finished till within this hour,) she found and brought me yours of this day.\n",
      "These few lines will perhaps be time enough deposited, to be taken away by your servant with the other letter: yet they are only to thank you, and to tell you my increasing apprehensions.\n",
      "I must take or seek the occasion to apply to my mother for her mediation; for I am in danger of having a day fixed, and antipathy taken for bashfulness.—Should not sisters be sisters to each other?\n",
      "Should not they make a common cause of it, as I may say, a cause of sex, on such occasions as the present?\n",
      "What the discharged steward reported of him is surely bad enough: what Mrs. Fortescue said, not only confirms that bad, but gives room to think him still worse.\n",
      "And yet the something further which my friends have come at, is of so heinous a nature (as Betty Barnes tells Hannah) that it proves him almost to be the worst of men.—But, hang the man, I had almost said—What is he to me?\n",
      "What would he be—were not this Mr. Sol——O my dear, how I hate the man in the light he is proposed to me!\n",
      "I believe the gentlest spirits when provoked (causelessly and cruelly provoked) are the most determined.\n",
      "It is very unhappy, my dear, since your friends will have you marry, that a person of your merit should be addressed by a succession of worthless creatures, who have nothing but their presumption for their excuse.\n",
      "But where indeed is the man to be found (who has the least share of due diffidence) that dares to look up to Miss Clarissa Harlowe with hope, or with any thing but wishes?\n",
      "Yet I am afraid all opposition will be in vain.\n",
      "Poisons and poniard have often been set to work by minds inflamed by disappointed love, and actuated by revenge.—Will you wonder, then, that the ties of relationship in such a case have no force, and that a sister forgets to be a sister?\n",
      "Mean time, it is now easy, as you will observe, to guess from what quarter the report I mentioned to you in one of my former, came, That the younger sister has robbed the elder of her lover:* for Betty whispered it, at the time she whispered the rest, that neither Lovelace nor you had done honourably by her young mistress.—How cruel, my dear, in you, to rob the poor Bella of the only lover she only had!—At the instant too that she was priding herself, that now at last she should have it in her power not only to gratify her own susceptibilities, but to give an example to the flirts of her sex** (my worship's self in her eye) how to govern their man with a silken rein, and without a curb-bridle!\n",
      "But had you been actually in possession of that estate, and living up to it, and upon it, (your youth protected from blighting tongues by the company of your prudent Norton, as you had proposed,) do you think that your brother, grudging it to you at the time as he did, and looking upon it as his right as an only son, would have been practising about it, and aiming at it?\n",
      "I told you some time ago, that I thought your trials but proportioned to your prudence:* but you will be more than woman, if you can extricate yourself with honour, having such violent spirits and sordid minds in some, and such tyrannical and despotic wills in others, to deal with.\n",
      "Indeed, all may be done, and the world be taught further to admire you for your blind duty and will-less resignation, if you can persuade yourself to be Mrs. Solmes.\n",
      "He has qualities, in short, that may make him a tolerable creature on the other side of fifty: but God help the poor woman to whose lot he shall fall till then!\n",
      "women, I should say, perhaps; since he may break half-a-dozen hearts before that time.—But to the point I was upon—Shall we not have reason to commend the tenant's grateful honesty, if we are told, that with joy the poor man called out your uncle, and on the spot paid him in part of his debt those two guineas?—But what shall we say of that landlord, who, though he knew the poor man to be quite destitute, could take it; and, saying nothing while Mr. Lovelace staid, as soon as he was gone, tell of it in praise of the poor fellow's honesty?—Were this so, and were not that landlord related to my dearest friend, how should I despise such a wretch?—But, perhaps, the story is aggravated.\n",
      "I long for your next letter.\n",
      "O my dear friend, I have had a sad conflict!\n",
      "I need not give you the particulars; since what I have to relate to you from different conversations that have passed between my mother and me, in the space of a very few hours, will include them all.\n",
      "He took the removed chair, and drew it so near mine, squatting in it with his ugly weight, that he pressed upon my hoop.—I was so offended (all I had heard, as I said, in my head) that I removed to another chair.\n",
      "I saw that my father was excessively displeased.\n",
      "When angry, no man's countenance ever shews it so much as my father's.\n",
      "said I, trembling and courtesying (for I had not then sat down again); and put my chair nearer the wretch, and sat down—my face, as I could feel, all in a glow.\n",
      "Before the usual breakfast-time was over, my father withdrew with my mother, telling her he wanted to speak with her.\n",
      "I arose; the man hemming up for a speech, rising, and beginning to set his splay-feet [indeed, my dear, the man in all his ways is hateful to me] in an approaching posture.—I will save my brother the trouble of bringing to me his curiosity, said I. I courtesied—Your servant, sir—The man cried, Madam, Madam, twice, and looked like a fool.—But away I went—to find my brother, to save my word.—But my brother, indifferent as the weather was, was gone to walk in the garden with my sister.\n",
      "A plain case, that he had left his curiosity with me, and designed to shew me no other.\n",
      "My father, Hannah told me, was just gone out of it with a positive angry countenance.\n",
      "I went down however; but, apprehending the subject she intended to talk to me upon, approached her trembling, and my heart in visible palpitations.\n",
      "My mother saw the bitter pill wanted gilding.\n",
      "was all I could say; and I clasped my arms round her neck, and my face sunk into her bosom.\n",
      "I dare not else trust myself with you.—And my tears trickled down her bosom, as hers bedewed my neck.\n",
      "You have sometimes seemed to pity me, that I am obliged to give up every point.\n",
      "Poor man!\n",
      "There went the dagger to my heart, and down I sunk: and when I recovered, found myself in the arms of my Hannah, my sister's Betty holding open my reluctantly-opened palm, my laces cut, my linen scented with hartshorn; and my mother gone.\n",
      "Shorey came in with a message (delivered in her solemn way): Your mamma, Miss, is concerned for your disorder: she expects you down again in an hour; and bid me say, that she then hopes every thing from your duty.\n",
      "She took my hand, led the way, and made me sit down by her: and after she had inquired how I did, she began in a strain as if she supposed I had made use of the intervening space to overcome all my objections.\n",
      "Tell me (I have a right to know) whether you prefer this man to all others?—Yet God forbid that I should know you do; for such a declaration would make us all miserable.\n",
      "And pray, let me ask my dearest Mamma, in what has my conduct been faulty, that, like a giddy creature, I must be forced to marry, to save me from—From what?\n",
      "I won't be interrupted, Clary—You have seen in my behaviour to you, on this occasion, a truly maternal tenderness; you have observed that I have undertaken the task with some reluctance, because the man is not every thing; and because I know you carry your notions of perfection in a man too high—\n",
      "\n",

      "I thought it was hard to be thus given up by my mother; and that she should make a will so uncontroulable as my brother's, her will.—My mother, my dear, though I must not say so, was not obliged to marry against her liking.\n",

      "I will send you these letters for your perusal in a few days.\n",
      "Take your letters, Clary: I have nothing, she was pleased to say, to tax your discretion with, as to the wording of yours to him: you have even kept up a proper dignity, as well as observed all the rules of decorum; and you have resented, as you ought to resent, his menacing invectives.\n",

      "Without hesitation thus I answered—What I humbly propose is this:—'That I will write to Mr. Lovelace (for I have not answered his last) that he has nothing to do between my father and me: that I neither ask his advice nor need it: but that since he thinks he has some pretence for interfering, because of my brother's avowal of the interest of Mr. Solmes in displeasure to him, I will assure him (without giving him any reason to impute the assurance to be in the least favourable to himself) that I will never be that man's.'\n",
      "He has even given hopes to your brother that he will make exchanges of estates; or, at least, that he will purchase the northern one; for you know it must be entirely consistent with the family-views, that we increase our interest in this country.\n",
      "And for the sake of these views, for the sake of this plan of my brother's, am I, Madam, to be given in marriage to a man I can never endure!—O my dear Mamma, save me, save me, if you can, from this heavy evil.—I had rather be buried alive, indeed I had, than have that man!\n",
      "What a name have you got, at a less expense?\n",
      "And what an opportunity had he of obtaining credit at a very small one, succeeding such a wretched creature as Sir Oliver, in fortunes so vast?—Yet has he so behaved, that the common phrase is applied to him, That Sir Oliver will never be dead while Mr. Solmes lives.\n",
      "Would you not have thought something might have been obtained in my favour, from an offer so reasonable, from an expedient so proper, as I imagine, to put a tolerable end, as from myself, to a correspondence I hardly know how otherwise, with safety to some of my family, to get rid of?—But my brother's plan, (which my mother spoke of, and of which I have in vain endeavoured to procure a copy, with a design to take it to pieces, and expose it, as I question not there is room to do,) joined with my father's impatience of contradiction, are irresistible.\n",
      "I have not been in bed all night; nor am I in the least drowsy.\n",
      "I stept down at my usual time, that it might not be known I had not been in bed; and gave directions in the family way.\n",
      "Sit down, Clary Harlowe; I shall talk to you by-and-by: and continued looking into a drawer among laces and linens, in a way neither busy nor unbusy.\n",
      "I believe it was a quarter of an hour before she spoke to me (my heart throbbing with the suspense all the time); and then she asked me coldly, What directions I had given for the day?\n",
      "She made a small alteration in it; but with an air so cold and so solemn, as added to my emotions.\n",
      "Sit down when I bid you.\n",
      "I sat down.\n",
      "She then went to her toilette, and looked into the glass, and gave half a sigh—the other half, as if she would not have sighed if she could have helped it, she gently hem'd away.\n",
      "Indeed, Madam, I am not sullen.—And I arose, and, turning from her, drew out my handkerchief; for the tears ran down my cheeks.\n",
      "She seemed struck; but was to be angry with me.\n",
      "No sullens, my Mamma: no perverseness: but, worse than either: this is direct disobedience!—Yet tear not yourself from me!\n",
      "I arose trembling, and, hardly knowing what I did, or how I stood or walked, withdrew to my chamber.\n",
      "It was near two hours before I could so far recover myself as to take up my pen, to write to you how unhappily my hopes have ended.\n",
      "My mother went down to breakfast.\n",
      "Hannah has just now brought me from the usual place your favour of yesterday.\n",
      "As to what you mention of my sister's value for Mr. Lovelace, I am not very much surprised at it.\n",
      "She never tells the story of their parting, and of her refusal of him, but her colour rises, she looks with disdain upon me, and mingles anger with the airs she gives herself:—anger as well as airs, demonstrating, that she refused a man whom she thought worth accepting: Where else is the reason either for anger or boast?—Poor Bella!\n",
      "Your advice to me on the subject was grounded, as I remember, on your good opinion of me; believing that I should not make a bad use of the power willed me.\n",
      "You never loved them; and ill-will has eyes ever open to the faulty side; as good-will or love is blind even to real imperfections.\n",
      "Indeed, no!—I am afraid the very contrary.\n",
      "Hannah informs me, that she heard my father high and angry with my mother, at taking leave of her: I suppose for being to favourable to me; for Hannah heard her say, as in tears, 'Indeed, Mr. Harlowe, you greatly distress me!—The poor girl does not deserve—' Hannah heard no more, but that he said, he would break somebody's heart—Mine, I suppose—Not my mother's, I hope.\n",
      "As only my sister dines with my mother, I thought I should have been commanded down: but she sent me up a plate from her table.\n",
      "The expected conference is over: but my difficulties are increased.\n",
      "I have made, said she, as she entered my room, a short as well as early dinner, on purpose to confer with you: and I do assure you, that it will be the last conference I shall either be permitted or inclined to hold with you on the subject, if you should prove as refractory as it is imagined you will prove by some, who are of opinion, that I have not the weight with you which my indulgence deserves.\n",
      "She looked with concern and anger upon me—No compliance, I find!—Such a dutiful young creature hitherto!—Will you not, can you not, speak as I would have you speak?—Then [rejecting me as it were with her hand] continue silent.—I, no more than your father, will bear your avowed contradiction.\n",
      "I was still silent; looking down; the tears in my eyes.\n",
      "Be ingenuous: you used to be so, even occasionally against yourself:—Who at the long run must submit—all of us to you; or you to all of us?—If you intend to yield at last if you find you cannot conquer, yield now, and with a grace—for yield you must, or be none of our child.\n",
      "I am sorry, Madam, that I have had so little merit as to have made no deeper impressions of favour for me in their hearts: but I will love and honour them as long as I live.\n",
      "You are sullen, Clarissa: I see you are sullen.—And she walked about the room in anger.\n",
      "I was afraid of telling you all I was enjoined to tell you, in case you were to be unpersuadable: but I find that I had a greater opinion of your delicacy, of your gentleness, than I needed to have—it cannot discompose so steady, so inflexible a young creature, to be told, as I now tell you, that the settlements are actually drawn; and that you will be called down in a very few days to hear them read, and to sign them: for it is impossible, if your heart be free, that you can make the least objection to them; except it will be an objection with you, that they are so much in your favour, and in the favour of all our family.\n",
      "I am sorry, said she, for your averseness to this match: [match she was pleased to call it!]\n",
      "O do not, do not, make all the remainder of it miserable!\n",
      "She was very angry.\n",
      "He has pleaded, poor man!\n",
      "and as I wish, that he does not suspect that I secretly favour the address of a vile rake, (a character which all the sex, he is pleased to say, virtuous and vicious, are but too fond of!)\n",
      "to exert my authority over you: and that this I may the less scrupulously do, as you have owned [the old string!]\n",
      "Affected by my mother's goodness to me, and by that part of her argument which related to her own peace, and to the suspicions they had of her secretly inclining to prefer the man so hated by them, to the man so much my aversion, I could not but wish it were possible for me to obey, I therefore paused, hesitated, considered, and was silent for some time.\n",
      "But then recollecting, that all was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister, wholly actuated by selfish and envious views; that I had not deserved the treatment I had of late met with; that my disgrace was already become the public talk; that the man was Mr. Solmes; and that my aversion to him was too generally known, to make my compliance either creditable to myself or to them: that it would give my brother and sister a triumph over me, and over Mr. Lovelace, which they would not fail to glory in; and which, although it concerned me but little to regard on his account, yet might be attended with fatal mischiefs—And then Mr. Solmes's disagreeable person; his still more disagreeable manners; his low understanding—Understanding!\n",
      "You cannot, indeed you cannot, think, how my whole soul resists him!—And to talk of contracts concluded upon; of patterns; of a short day!—Save me, save me, O my dearest Mamma, save your child, from this heavy, from this insupportable evil—!\n",
      "Never was there a countenance that expressed so significantly, as my mother's did, an anguish, which she struggled to hide, under an anger she was compelled to assume—till the latter overcoming the former, she turned from me with an uplifted eye, and stamping—Strange perverseness!\n",
      "were the only words I heard of a sentence that she angrily pronounced; and was going.\n",
      "You have my pity!\n",
      "But why, when you know it does not, why should you thus perplex and urge me?—To renounce Mr. Lovelace is now but half what is aimed at.\n",
      "While you remain single, Mr. Lovelace will have hopes—and you, in the opinion of others, inclinations.\n",
      "You have not brought me up to be mean.\n",
      "I have had too much cause before to apprehend as much—What will this come to?—I, and then my dear mamma sighed—I, am forced to put up with many humours—\n",

      "I would have thee, Jack, come down, as soon as thou canst.\n",
      "Yet they may come down to Lord M.'s.\n",

      "Every poor body, particularly, knows it: but that only for a few years past, since a certain angel has appeared there among the sons and daughters of men.\n",
      "Thou wilt see in her mind, all that her superiors have been taught to conceal, in order to render themselves less natural, and of consequence less pleasing.\n",
      "She is the only flower of fragrance, that has blown in this vicinage for ten years past, or will for ten years to come: for I have looked backward to the have-been's, and forward to the will-be's; having but too much leisure upon my hands in my present waiting.\n",
      "It behoves me so to be—some way or other, my recess at this little inn may be found out; and it will then be thought that my Rose-bud has attracted me.\n",
      "A report in my favour, from simplicities so amiable, may establish me; for the grandmother's relation to my Rose-bud may be sworn to: and the father is an honest, poor man; has no joy, but in his Rose-bud.—O Jack!\n",
      "spare thou, therefore, (for I shall leave thee often alone with her, spare thou) my Rose-bud!—Let the rule I never departed from, but it cost me a long regret, be observed to my Rose-bud!—never to ruin a poor girl, whose simplicity and innocence were all she had to trust to; and whose fortunes were too low to save her from the rude contempts of worse minds than her own, and from an indigence extreme: such a one will only pine in secret; and at last, perhaps, in order to refuge herself from slanderous tongues and virulence, be induced to tempt some guilty stream, or seek her end in the knee-encircling garter, that peradventure, was the first attempt of abandoned love.—No defiances will my Rose-bud breathe; no self-dependent, thee-doubting watchfulness (indirectly challenging thy inventive machinations to do their worst) will she assume.\n",
      "Unsuspicious of her danger, the lamb's throat will hardly shun thy knife!—O be not thou the butcher of my lambkin!\n",
      "I once caught her eye following a young carpenter, a widow neighbour's son, living [to speak in her dialect] at the little white house over the way.\n",
      "This answered (for, unseen, I was behind her) by a low courtesy, and a sigh, that Johnny was too far off to hear!—Happy whelp!\n",
      "I have examined the little heart.\n",
      "Why not be thought of!—She don't know!—And then she sighed: But Johnny has an aunt, who will give him an hundred pounds, when his time is out; and her father cannot give her but a few things, or so, to set her out with: and though Johnny's mother says, she knows not where Johnny would have a prettier, or notabler wife, yet—And then she sighed again—What signifies talking?—I would not have Johnny be unhappy and poor for me!—For what good would that do me, you know, Sir!\n",
      "And yet where there is not virtue, which nevertheless we freelivers are continually plotting to destroy, what is there even in the ultimate of our wishes with them?—Preparation and expectation are in a manner every thing: reflection indeed may be something, if the mind be hardened above feeling the guilt of a past trespass: but the fruition, what is there in that?\n",
      "In the next place, it will perhaps afford me an opportunity of a private interview with her, which I am meditating, let her take it as she will; having found out by my spy (who can keep off every body else) that she goes every morning and evening to a wood-house remote from the dwelling-house, under pretence of visiting and feeding a set of bantam-poultry, which were produced from a breed that was her grandfather's, and of which for that reason she is very fond; as also of some other curious fowls brought from the same place.\n",
      "But I was obliged previously to give him my honour, that no mischief should happen to any of my adversaries, from this liberty: for the fellow tells me, that he loves all his masters: and, only that he knows I am a man of honour; and that my alliance will do credit to the family; and after prejudices are overcome, every body will think so; or he would not for the world act the part he does.\n",
      "But what this stupid family can mean, to make all this necessary, I cannot imagine.\n",
      "What tho' his mighty soul his grief contains?\n",
      "He meditates revenge who least complains:\n",
      " And like a lion slumb'ring in his way,\n",
      " Or sleep dissembling, while he waits his prey,\n",
      " His fearless foes within his distance draws,\n",
      " Constrains his roaring, and contracts his paws:\n",
      " Till at the last, his time for fury found,\n",
      " He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:\n",
      " The prostrate vulgar passes o'er, and spares,\n",
      " But, with a lordly rage, his hunter tears.\n",
      "I have been frighted out of my wits—still am in a manner out of breath—thus occasioned—I went down, under the usual pretence, in hopes to find something from you.\n",
      "Concerned at my disappointment, I was returning from the wood-house, when I heard a rustling as of somebody behind a stack of wood.\n",
      "I then commanded him to leave the place that moment; and was hurrying from him, when he threw himself in the way at my feet, beseeching my stay for one moment; declaring, that he suffered himself to be guilty of this rashness, as I thought it, to avoid one much greater:—for, in short, he could not bear the hourly insults he received from my family, with the thoughts of having so little interest in my favour, that he could not promise himself that his patience and forbearance would be attended with any other issue than to lose me for ever, and be triumphed over and insulted upon it.\n",
      "You have said, that he ought, in small points, frequently to offend, on purpose to shew what an address he is master of.\n",
      "As to the perseverance I mentioned, it was impossible for him not to persevere: but I must needs know, that were he not in being, the terms Solmes had proposed were such, as would have involved me in the same difficulties with my relations that I now laboured under.\n",
      "They had made it impossible [he told me, with too much truth] to oblige them any way, but by sacrificing myself to Solmes.\n",
      "And then he asked me, if I would receive a letter from Lady Betty Lawrance, on this occasion: for Lady Sarah Sadleir, he said, having lately lost her only child, hardly looked into the world, or thought of it farther than to wish him married, and, preferably to all the women in the world, with me.\n",
      "He was proceeding, as I thought, with reflections of this sort; and I angrily told him, I would not permit my father to be reflected upon; adding, that his severity to me, however unmerited, was not a warrant for me to dispense with my duty to him.\n",
      "And yet he must own, that it was painful to him, who had youth and passions to be allowed for, as well as others, and who had always valued himself under speaking his mind, to curb himself, under such treatment.\n",
      "Nor is it a very bad indication, that he has such moderate notions of that very high prerogative in husbands, of which we in our family have been accustomed to hear so much.\n",
      "I can't say, but his openness in these particulars gives a credit to his other professions.\n",
      "You have always joined with me in remarking, that he will speak his mind with freedom, even to a degree of unpoliteness sometimes; and that his very treatment of my family is a proof that he cannot make a mean court to any body for interest sake—What pity, where there are such laudable traces, that they should have been so mired, and choaked up, as I may say!—We have heard, that the man's head is better than his heart: But do you really think Mr. Lovelace can have a very bad heart?\n",
      "Yet what a look of censoriousness does it carry in an unsparing friend, to take one to task for doing that justice, and making those which one ought without scruple to do, and to make, in the behalf of any other man living?\n",
      "He said, that people of birth stood a little too much upon punctilio; as people of value also did (but indeed birth, worthily lived up to, was virtue: virtue, birth; the inducements to a decent punctilio the same; the origin of both one): [how came this notion from him!]\n",
      "It might look like vanity in me perhaps to say, that this urgency in him, on this occasion, wore the face of art, in order to engage me into measures from which I might not easily extricate myself.\n",
      "And I hoped, that he would not have the thought of engaging me to carry it on by menacing my relations.\n",
      "He so much valued my free choice, he said, and my unbiassed favour, (scorning to set himself upon a footing with Solmes in the compulsory methods used in that man's behalf,) that he should hate himself, were he capable of a view of intimidating me by so very poor a method.\n",
      "And what less did the world think of me now, he asked, than that I was confined that I might not?\n",
      "And give me leave to say, proceeded he, that if a correspondence, on which I have founded all my hopes, is, at this critical conjuncture, to be broken off; and if you are resolved not to be provided against the worst; it must be plain to me, that you will at last yield to that worst—worst to me only—it cannot be to you—and then!\n",
      "I told him plainly that he might thank himself (whose indifferent character, as to morals, had given such a handle against him) for all.\n",
      "It was but just, that a man should be spoken evil of, who set no value upon his reputation.\n",
      "I said, I would try every method, that either my duty or my influence upon any of them should suggest, before I would put myself into any other protection: and, if nothing else would do, would resign the envied estate; and that I dared to say would.\n",
      "I have written a very long letter.\n",
      "To be so particular as you require in subjects of conversation, it is impossible to be short.\n",
      "And indeed what can I write that I have not already written?—You know, that I can do nothing but rave at your stupid persecutors: and that you don't like.\n",
      "I think you must be either the one man's or the other's.\n",
      "I wish you are not indeed angry with me for harping so much on one string.\n"

      "You, who are so famed for prescience, as I may call it; and than whom no young lady ever had stronger pretensions to a share of it; have had, no doubt, reasonings in your heart about him, supposing you were to be one day his: [no doubt but you have had the same in Solmes's case: whence the ground for the hatred of the one; and for the conditional liking of the other.]\n",
      "But, I dare say, you will not own either—nor is there, I hope, cause for either.\n",
      "as leaves little cause of doubt: but only when you affect reserve; when you give new words for common things; when you come with your curiosities, with your conditional likings, and with your PRUDE-encies [mind how I spell the word] in a case that with every other person defies all prudence—over-acts of treason all these, against the sovereign friendship we have avowed to each other.\n",

      "But, although I may intend no more than justice, it will perhaps be difficult to hinder those who know the man's views, from construing it as a partial favour: and especially if the eager-eyed observer has been formerly touched herself, and would triumph that her friend had been no more able to escape than she.\n",
      "My conduct must then have a faulty appearance at least, and I will endeavour to rectify it.\n",
      "To that letter I therefore refer, whether it make for me, or against me: and by the other, that I might bear in mind, what it became a person of my sex and character to be and to do, in such an unhappy situation, where the imputed love is thought an undutiful, and therefore a criminal passion; and where the supported object of it is a man of faulty morals too.\n",
      "It would, at least, I suppose they thought, have this effect; to render me inexcusable with her; or to let her see, that there was no room for the expostulations she had often wanted to make in my favour to my mother.\n",

      "She had both my brother and sister upon her for this: who referred to my mother, whether she had not treated me with an indulgence that had hardly any example?\n",
      "She was silenced, you will guess by whom,—with, My dear!—my dear!—You have ever something to say, something to palliate, for this rebel of a girl!—Remember her treatment of you, of me!—Remember, that the wretch, whom we so justly hate, would not dare persist in his purposes, but for her encouragement of him, and obstinacy to us.—Mrs.\n",
      "Norton, [angrily to her,] go up to her once more—and if you think gentleness will do, you have a commission to be gentle—if it will not, never make use of that plea again.\n",
      "They take not, I own, the right method with so generous a spirit.\n",

      "MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE [In continuation of the subject in Letter XXXVIII.]\n",
      "I will now, though midnight (for I have no sleep in my eyes) resume the subject I was forced so abruptly to quit, and will obey yours, Miss Lloyd's, Miss Campion's, and Miss Biddulph's call, with as much temper as my divided thought will admit.\n",
      "At his introduction into our family, his negative virtues were insisted upon:—He was no gamester; no horse-racer; no fox-hunter; no drinker: my poor aunt Hervey had, in confidence, given us to apprehend much disagreeable evil (especially to a wife of the least delicacy) from a wine-lover: and common sense instructed us, that sobriety in a man is no small point to be secured, when so many mischiefs happen daily from excess.\n",
      "He was no jester upon sacred things: poor Mr. Wyerley's fault; who seemed to think there was wit in saying bold things, which would shock a serious mind.\n",
      "'—If, I say, we may judge of him by this, we shall conclude in his favour, that he knows what sort of behaviour is to be expected from persons of birth, whether he act up to it or not.\n",
      "Conviction is half way to amendment.\n",
      "But it is impossible, say some, that he should make a tender or kind husband.\n",
      "Those who are for imposing upon me such a man as Mr. Solmes, and by methods so violent, are not entitled to make this objection.\n",
      "But now, on this subject, let me tell you how I have argued with myself—for still you must remember, that I am upon the extenuating part of his character.\n",
      "Perhaps she must practise as well as promise obedience, to a man so little used to controul; and must be careful to oblige.\n",
      "At worst, will he confine me prisoner to my chamber?\n",
      "Will he, as he has not a sister, permit his cousins Montague, or would either of those ladies accept of a permission, to insult and tyrannize over me?—It cannot be.—Why then, think I often, do you tempt me, O my cruel friends, to try the difference?\n",
      "And then has the secret pleasure intruded itself, to be able to reclaim such a man to the paths of virtue and honour: to be a secondary means, if I were to be his, of saving him, and preventing the mischiefs so enterprising a creature might otherwise be guilty of, if he be such a one.\n",
      "The world's opinion ought to be but a secondary consideration.\n",
      "The one, that his vices are so much his masters, that he attempts not to conquer them; the other, that he may think it policy, to give up one half of his character to save the other, when the whole may be blamable: by this means, silencing by acknowledgment the objections he cannot answer; which may give him the praise of ingenuousness, when he can obtain no other, and when the challenged proof might bring out, upon discussion, other evils.\n",
      "These, you will allow, are severe constructions; but every thing his enemies say of him cannot be false.\n",
      "And hence you concluded, that could this consentaneousness [as you call it] of corporal and animal faculties be pointed by discretion; that is to say, could his vivacity be confined within the pale of but moral obligations, he would be far from being rejectable as a companion for life.\n",
      "Divine Grace, working a miracle, or next to a miracle, can only change a bad heart.\n",
      "He is not, however, the only one who can see how truly blamable those errors are in another, which they hardly think such in themselves.\n",
      "I lay down my pen here, that you may consider of it a little, if you please.\n",
      "His outside usually runs away with him.\n",
      "To adorn, and perhaps, intending to adorn, to render ridiculous that person, takes up all his attention.\n",
      "All he does is personal; that is to say, for himself: all he admires, is himself: and in spite of the correction of the stage, which so often and so justly exposes a coxcomb, he usually dwindles down, and sinks into that character; and, of consequence, becomes the scorn of one sex, and the jest of the other.\n",
      "This is generally the case of your fine figures of men, and of those who value themselves on dress and outward appearance: whence it is, that I repeat, that mere person in a man is a despicable consideration.\n",
      "And as to the former, I should hold myself inexcusable, if I were to add to his vanity by shewing the least regard for what is too evidently so much his.\n"

      "So that your objection against the spirit of a man you think worse of than it deserves, will have no weight; but you will be more independent than a wife of less discretion than we attribute to you, perhaps ought to be.\n",
      "You know full well, that I, who first and last brought a still larger fortune into the family than you will carry to Mr. Solmes, had not a provision made me of near this that we have made for you.—Where people marry to their liking, terms are the least things stood upon—yet should I be sorry if you cannot (to oblige us all) overcome a dislike.\n",
      "Your behaviour hitherto has been such, that we have had no opportunity of entering minutely into the subject with you.\n",

      "An angry dialogue, a scolding-bout rather, has passed between my sister and me.\n",
      "She was sent up to me, upon my refusal to see Mr. Solmes—let loose upon me, I think!—No intention on their parts to conciliate!\n",
      "As I ask for your approbation or disapprobation of my conduct, upon the facts I lay before you, I should think it the sign of a very bad cause, if I endeavoured to mislead my judge.\n",
      "She said, that I had discovered a spirit they never had expected: that, if they had thought me such a championess, they would hardly have ventured to engage with me: but that now, the short and the long of it was, that the matter had gone too far to be given up: that it was become a contention between duty and willfulness; whether a parent's authority were to yield to a daughter's obstinacy, or the contrary: that I must therefore bend or break, that was all, child.\n",
      "But do you think I will rob my sister of her humble servant?\n",
      "for my poor sister!\n",
      "How true is the observation, That unrequited love turns to deepest hate!\n",
      "When so little ceremony is made with me, why should I not speak out?—Did he not seek to kill the other, if he could have done it?\n",
      "I expected to feel the weight of her hand.\n",
      "She did come up to me, with it held up: then, speechless with passion, ran half way down the stairs, and came up again.\n",
      "Amen, said I: but you see, Bella, how ill you bear the retort you provoke.\n",
      "Will you forgive me; and let me find a sister in you, as I am sorry, if you had reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said?\n",
      "I wished, I told her, I could make the plea for myself, which she might for herself; to wit, that my anger was more inexcusable than my judgment.\n",
      "I had before, upon hearing her ridiculing me on my supposed character of meekness, said, that, although I wished to be thought meek, I would not be abject; although humble not mean: and here, in a sneering way, she cautioned me on that head.\n",
      "I replied, that her pleasantry was much more agreeable than her anger.\n",
      "A poor dependence!\n",
      "At least, Bella, said I, you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged, that my father and mother, and every body else, treat me thus harshly.\n",
      "And then have we either been stopped by references to Miss Clary's opinion, forsooth; or been forced to stop ourselves, or must have talked on unattended to by every body.\n",
      "How did he use to hang, till he slabbered again, poor doting old man!\n",
      "This was too low to move me: O my poor sister!\n",
      "Specious little witch!\n",
      "curling, like a serpent about your mamma; and making her cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set upon—!\n",
      "All you speak of, Bella, was a long time ago.\n",
      "I cannot go so far back into our childish follies.\n",
      "Little did I think of how long standing your late-shewn antipathy is.\n",
      "Nobody thought I had two faces, when I gave up all into my father's management; taking from his bounty, as before, all my little pocket-money, without a shilling addition to my stipend, or desiring it—\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, cunning creature!—And that was another of your fetches!—For did it not engage my fond father (as no doubt you thought it would) to tell you, that since you had done so grateful and dutiful a thing, he would keep entire, for your use, all the produce of the estate left you, and be but your steward in it; and that you should be entitled to the same allowances as before?\n",
      "It is, however, out at interest!—And I hope it will bring me interest upon interest!—Better than to lie useless in my cabinet.\n",
      "This, indeed, Bella, is cruel in you, who have so largely contributed to my confinement.—But go on.\n",
      "None of your saucy contempts [rising in her voice]: None of your poor Bella's, with that air of superiority in a younger sister!\n",
      "courtesying—that will please you better—and it is due likewise to the hoards you boast of.\n",
      "Look ye, Clary, holding up her hand, if you are not a little more abject in your meekness, a little more mean in your humility, and treat me with the respect due to an elder sister—you shall find—\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that you will treat me worse than you have done, Bella!—That cannot be; unless you were to let fall your uplifted hand upon me—and that would less become you to do, than me to bear.\n",
      "And if he be not satisfied with such a condescension, I shall think he ought: and I will give any assurances, that I will neither correspond with him, nor see him.\n",
      "I would no more converse with the one, than correspond with the other.\n",
      "That would be to make Mr. Lovelace guilty of some rashness, on a belief, that I broke with him, to have Mr. Solmes.\n",
      "In either case, it may be given out, that I am gone to the other; or to the world's end.\n",

      "For my part, after I had read the unkind letter over and over, I concluded, upon the whole, that a reconciliation upon terms so disadvantageous to myself, as hardly any other person in my case, I dare say, would have proposed, must be the result of this morning's conference.\n",
      "Thus was I employed, not very agreeably, you may believe, because of the vehemence of the tempers I had to conflict with; when breakfasting-time approached, and my judges began to arrive.\n",

      "And how shall I look upon my awful judges?\n",

      "What!\n",

      "Will you go down, and humble that stubborn spirit of yours to your mamma?\n",
      "Shall I conduct your Ladyship down?\n",
      "Well, well, [insultingly wiping my averted face with her handkerchief, while her other hand held mine, in a ridiculing tone,] I am glad any thing will make thee speak: then you think you may be brought to speak the two words—only they are to be the last!—How like a gentle lovyer from its tender bleeding heart was that!\n",

      "If it were so, you seem resolved, for your part, and so does my brother for his, that I shall not want one.—But indeed, Bella, I can bear no longer this repetition of the worst part of yesterday's conversation: I desire I may throw myself at my father's and mother's feet, and hear from them what their sentence is.\n",
      "I shall at least avoid, by that means, the unsisterly insults I meet with from you.\n",
      "Yes, it is I, Bella; and I will claim the protection due to a child of the family, or to know why I am to be thus treated, when I offer only to preserve to myself the liberty of refusal, which belongs to my sex; and, to please my parents, would give up my choice.\n",
      "And while I have a father and mother living, I will not be thus treated by a brother and sister, and their servants, all setting upon me, as it should seem, to make me desperate, and do a rash thing.—I will know, in short, sister Bella, why I am to be constrained thus?—What is intended by it?—And whether I am to be considered as a child or a slave?\n",
      "She stood aghast all this time, partly with real, partly with affected, surprise.\n",
      "But since you are so desirous to refer yourself to your father and mother, I will go down, and tell them what you say.\n",
      "O how the poor Bella raved!\n",
      "I thought she would have beat me once or twice: and she vowed her fingers itched to do so—but I was not worth her anger: yet she flamed on.\n",
      "We were heard to be high.—And Betty came up from my mother to command my sister to attend her.—She went down accordingly, threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature I had shewn myself to be.\n",
      "I am indeed sorry that I sent her from me in such disorder.\n",
      "But my papa's letter threatening me with my uncle Antony's house and chapel, terrifies me strangely; and by their silence I'm afraid some new storm is gathering.\n",
      "When she entered my chamber, I told her, that this visit was a high favour to a poor prisoner, in her hard confinement.\n",
      "In short, fain would my aunt have furnished me with an excuse to come off my opposition; Bell all the while humming a tune, and opening this book and that, without meaning; but saying nothing.\n",
      "I therefore desired to know, whether my answer, if it should be in favour of Mr. Wyerley, would release me from Mr. Solmes?—For I owned, that I had not the aversion to him, that I had to the other.\n",
      "Don't you, dear Madam, said I, put questions that can answer no end, but to support my brother's schemes against me.—But are there any hopes of an end to my sufferings and disgrace, without having this hated man imposed upon me?\n",
      "Why, Niece, if there be not any such hopes, I presume you don't think yourself absolved from the duty due from a child to her parents?\n",

      "Yet then, the common phrases of wild oats, and black oxen, and such-like, were qualifiers; and marriage, and the wife's discretion, were to perform wonders—but (turning to my sister) I find I have said too much.\n",
      "Now, Clary, said she, would I give a thousand pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart at this moment.\n",
      "I might let you know for a much less sum, and not be afraid of being worse treated than I have been.\n",
      "Well, young ladies, I am sorry to see passion run so high between you.\n",
      "If you do, Madam, can you think confinement and ill usage is the way to prevent the apprehended rashness?\n",
      "That apprehension, Madam, seems to have been conceived before this intimation, or the least cause for it, was given.\n",

      "At least, this I will say, that all the arguments he then used with you, seemed to be just and right.\n",
      "And if you are to be his—But no more of that: he cannot, after all, deserve you.\n",
      "An unexpected visitor has turned the course of my thoughts, and changed the subject I had intended to pursue.\n",
      "The only one for whom I would have dispensed with my resolution not to see any body all the dedicated day: a visiter, whom, according to Mr. Hickman's report from the expectations of his libertine friends, I supposed to be in town.—Now, my dear, have I saved myself the trouble of telling you, that it was you too-agreeable rake.\n",
      "He gave me fresh instance of indignities cast upon himself by your uncles and brother; and declared, that if you suffered yourself to be forced into the arms of the man for whose sake he was loaded with undeserved abuses, you should be one of the youngest, as you would be one of the loveliest widows in England.\n",
      "I told him, That with regard to the mischief he threatened, neither the act nor the menace could serve any end but theirs who persecuted you; as it would give them a pretence for carrying into effect their compulsory projects; and that with the approbation of all the world; since he must not think the public would give its voice in favour of a violent young man, of no extraordinary character as to morals, who should seek to rob a family of eminence of a child so valuable; and who threatened, if he could not obtain her in preference to a man chosen by themselves, that he would avenge himself upon them all by acts of violence.\n",
      "Miss Clarissa Harlowe, Mr. Lovelace, let me tell you, said I, timid as her foresight and prudence may make her in some cases, where she apprehends dangers to those she loves, is above fear, in points where her honour, and the true dignity of her sex, are concerned.—In short, Sir, you must not think to frighten Miss Clarissa Harlowe into such a mean or unworthy conduct as only a weak or unsteady mind can be guilty of.\n",
      "He was so very far from intending to intimidate you, he said, that he besought me not to mention one word to you of what had passed between us: that what he had hinted at, which carried the air of menace, was owing to the fervour of his spirits, raised by his apprehensions of losing all hope of you for ever; and on a supposition, that you were to be actually forced into the arms of a man you hated: that were this to be the case, he must own, that he should pay very little regard to the world, or its censures: especially as the menaces of some of your family now, and their triumph over him afterwards, would both provoke and warrant all the vengeance he could take.\n",
      "Adding, that he knew the family so well, and how much fixed they were upon their measures, as well as the absolute dependence they had upon your temper and principles, that he could not but apprehend the worst, while you remained in their power, and under the influence of their persuasions and menaces.\n",
      "This man is a violent man.\n",
      "Mean time, let me have your clear opinion of the resumption, which I join with Lovelace in advising.\n",

      "     puppets danced upon Mr. Lovelace's wires, as he boasts, Vol.\n",
      "I inclose the rough draught of it.\n",
      "You will see by it how much his vile hint from the Georgic; and his rude one of my whining vocatives, have set me up.\n",
      "Nor is either my sex or myself, though a sister, I see entitled to the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it seems, rather to cultivate the malevolence of his natural temper, than any tendency which one might have hoped his parentage, if not his education, might have given him to a tolerable politeness.\n",
      "The time is indeed come that I can no longer bear those contempts and reflections which a brother, least of all men, is entitled to give.\n",
      "One word more, provoked as I am, I will add: That had I been thought as really obstinate and perverse as of late I am said to be, I should not have been so disgracefully treated as I have been—Lay your hand upon your heart, Brother, and say, By whose instigations?—And examine what I have done to deserve to be made thus unhappy, and to be obliged to style myself\n",

      "So desperate was my case, I was resolved not to stop even at this repulse.\n",

      "How strangely are you altered!\n",
      "Yet a club will beat down a sword: And how can you expect that they who are hurt by you will not hurt you again?\n",
      "We are all afraid to see you, because we know we shall be made as so many fools.\n",
      "Nay, your mother is so afraid of you, that once or twice, when she thought you were coming to force yourself into her presence, she shut the door, and locked herself in, because she knew she must not see you upon your terms, and you are resolved you will not see her upon hers.\n",
      "Had you not been so rudely affronting to him, he would have made your ears tingle with what he could have told you of the other.\n",
      "Your father, mother, and I, will divide the pleasure, and the honour, I will again call it, between us; and all past offences shall be forgiven; and Mr. Solmes, we will engage, shall take nothing amiss hereafter, of what has passed.\n",
      "I have set up half the night to write this.\n",
      "He bid Betty bring him down a verbal answer: a written one, he said, would be a bad sign: and he bid her therefore not to bring a letter.\n",
      "I found this morning, in the usual place, a letter from him, in answer, I suppose, to mine of Friday, which I deposited not till Saturday.\n",
      "Let me but be permitted to avoid the man I hate; and I will give up with cheerfulness the man I could prefer.\n",
      "But the other, to marry a man one cannot endure, is not only a dishonest thing, as to the man; but it is enough to make a creature who wishes to be a good wife, a bad or indifferent one, as I once wrote to the man himself: and then she can hardly be either a good mistress, or a good friend; or any thing but a discredit to her family, and a bad example to all around her.\n",
      "I have deposited my narrative down to this day noon; but I hope soon to follow it with another letter, that I may keep you as little a while as possible in that suspense which I am so much affected by at this moment: for my heart is disturbed at ever foot I hear stir; and at every door below that I hear open or shut.\n",
      "But I will deny myself this piece of curiosity till that which is raised by my present suspense is answered.—Excuse me, my dear, that I thus trouble you with my uncertainties: but I have no employment, nor heart, if I had, to pursue any other but what my pen affords me.\n",
      "It would look as if they had treated me thus hardly, as I think it, for this very purpose.\n",
      "I was curious to know who it was.\n",
      "But do you not see, my dear, what a sad creature she is whom you honour with your friendship?—You could not doubt your influence over me: Why did you not take the friendly liberty I have always taken with you, and tell me my faults, and what a specious hypocrite I am?\n",
      "Thus are those imputed qualifications, which used so lately to gain me applause, now become my crimes: so much do disgust and anger alter the property of things.\n",
      "The result of their debate, I suppose, will somehow or other be communicated to me by-and-by.\n",
      "But let me tell you, my dear, that I am made so desperate, that I am afraid to open Mr. Lovelace's letter, lest, in the humour I am in, I should do something (if I find it not exceptionable) that may give me repentance as long as I live.\n",

      "I find I am a very sad creature, and did not know it.\n",
      "Perhaps one day you may think you have been prevailed upon (for that is plainly the case!)\n",
      "But, Sir, from your pen let me have an answer; I humbly implore it of you.\n",
      "But whom have I moved?—One person in the family has more moving ways than I have, or he could never so undeservedly have made every body ashamed to show tenderness to a poor distressed child of the same family.\n",
      "Return me not this with contempt, or torn, or unanswered, I beseech you.\n",
      "When what I have before written in the humblest strain has met with such strange constructions, I am afraid that this unguarded scrawl will be very ill received.\n",
      "But I beg, Sir, you will oblige me with one line, be it ever so harsh, in answer to my proposal.\n",
      "Betty scrupled again to carry this letter; and said, she should have anger; and I should have it returned in scraps and bits.\n",
      "Sad doings!\n",
      "very sad!\n",
      "she said, that young ladies should so violently set themselves against their duty.\n",

      "'He laments, as usual, my ill opinion of him, and readiness to believe every thing to his disadvantage.\n",
      "He puts into plain English, as I supposed he would, my hint, that I might be happier, if, by any rashness he might be guilty of to Solmes, he should come to an untimely end himself.'\n",
      "He is concerned, he says, 'That the violence he had expressed on his extreme apprehensiveness of losing me, should have made him guilty of any thing I had so much reason to resent.'\n",
      "But appeals to me, 'Whether, if any occasion in the world could excuse the rashness of his expressions, it would not be his present dreadful situation, through my indifference, and the malice of his enemies.'\n",
      "'Solemn vows of reformation, and everlasting truth and obligingness, he makes; all in the style of desponding humility: yet calls it a cruel turn upon him, to impute his protestations to a consciousness of the necessity there is for making them from his bad character.\n",
      "'He despises himself, he solemnly protests, for his past follies.\n",
      "'He presumes not, he says, to write by way of menace to me; but if I refuse him this favour, he knows not (so desperate have some strokes in my letter made him) what his despair may make him do.'\n",
      "He beseeches me therefore, 'To unbolt the door, as that very night; or, if I receive not this time enough, this night;—and he will, in a disguise that shall not give suspicion who he is, if he should be seen, come to the garden door, in hopes to open it with his key; nor will he have any other lodging than in the coppice both nights; watching every wakeful hour for the propitious unbolting, unless he has a letter with my orders to the contrary, or to make some other appointment.'\n",
      "This letter was dated yesterday: so he was there last night, I suppose; and will be there this night; and I have not written a line to him: and now it is too late, were I determined what to write.\n",
      "Your mother has nevertheless prevailed to have your going to your uncle Antony's put off till Thursday: yet owns you deserve not that, or any other favour from her.\n",
      "I will receive no more of your letters.\n",
      "How can I think of this!—They will make me desperate.\n",
      "Why did he not flame out in his letter?—Treated as I am treated by my friends, it is dangerous to be laid under the sense of an obligation to an addresser's patience; especially when such a one suffers in health for my sake.\n",
      "He owns, 'That he has an intelligencer in our family; who has failed him for a day or two past: and not knowing how I do, or how I may be treated, his anxiety is increased.'\n",
      "I have been often jealous of this Leman in my little airings and poultry-visits.\n",
      "'It is impossible, he says, but one of these methods must do.\n",
      "Presence, he observes, even of a disliked person, takes off the edge of resentments which absence whets, and makes keen.\n",
      "He says, 'He has business of consequence in London: but cannot stir from the inconvenient spot where he has for some time resided, in disguises unworthy of himself, until he can be absolutely certain, that I shall not be prevailed upon, either by force or otherwise; and until he finds me delivered from the insults of my brother.\n",
      "He is convinced, he says, that he has already run a long and dangerous course; and that it is high time to think of returning.\n",
      "'All generous spirits, he observes, hate compulsion.\n",
      "Upon this observation he dwells; but regrets, that he is likely to owe all his hopes to this compulsion; this injudicious compulsion, he justly calls it; and none to my esteem for him.\n",
      "Although he presumes upon some merit—in this implicit regard to my will—in the bearing the daily indignities offered not only to him, but to his relations, by my brother—in the nightly watchings, his present indisposition makes him mention, or he had not debased the nobleness of his passion for me, by such a selfish instance.'\n",
      "I cannot but say, I am sorry the man is not well.\n",
      "I am afraid to ask you, my dear, what you would have done, thus situated.\n",
      "It is plain he was in waiting: for I had walked but a few paces, after I had deposited it, when, my heart misgiving me, I returned, to have taken it back, in order to reconsider it as I walked, and whether I should or should not let it go.\n",
      "In all probability, there was but a brick wall, of a few inches thick, between Mr. Lovelace and me, at the very time I put the letter under the brick!\n",
      "If I do not, he may take some violent measures.\n",
      "What he knows of the treatment I meet with in malice to him, and with the view to frustrate all his hopes, may make him desperate.\n",
      "What he requires is not unreasonable, and cannot affect my future choice and determination: it is only to assure him from my own lips, that I never will be the wife of a man I hate.\n",
      "If I have not an opportunity to meet without hazard or detection, he must once more bear the disappointment.\n",
      "All his trouble, and mine too, is owing to his faulty character.\n",
      "This, although I hate tyranny and arrogance in all shapes, makes me think less of the risques he runs, and the fatigues he undergoes, than otherwise I should do; and still less, as my sufferings (derived from the same source) are greater than his.\n",
      "I have mentioned several times the pertness of Mrs. Betty to me; and now, having a little time upon my hands, I will give you a short dialogue that passed just now between us.\n",
      "It may, perhaps, be a little relief to you from the dull subjects with which I am perpetually teasing you.\n",
      "But what is the other, Madam?\n",
      "Then with another pinch—I cannot indeed but say, bridling upon it, that I have heard famous scholars often and often say very silly things: things I should be ashamed myself to say; but I thought they did it out of humility, and in condescension to those who had not their learning.\n",
      "No, Mrs. Betty, I am pretty well used to your freedoms now, you know.—I am not displeased in the main, to observe, that, were the succession of modern fine ladies to be extinct, it might be supplied from those whom they place in the next rank to themselves, their chamber-maids and confidants.\n",
      "And hence may my sister's brilliancy and my stupidity be both accounted for.\n",
      "Whether I am willing or not willing, you mean, I suppose, Mrs. Betty?\n",
      "You seem angry, Miss.\n",
      "Every body takes notice, Miss, that you can say very cutting words in a cool manner, and yet not call names, as I have known some gentlefolks as well as others do when in a passion.\n",
      "And know you any of the particulars of those sad stories?\n",
      "For what with this letter of yours to 'Squire Solmes, whom they so much value, and what with their antipathy to 'Squire Lovelace, whom they hate, they will have no patience with you.\n",
      "And no pen and ink will be allowed you as here; where they are of opinion you make no good use of it: nor would it be allowed here, only as they intend so soon to send you away to your uncle's.\n",
      "But I see I am destined to be a very unhappy creature.\n",
      "And so, quite sick of the pert creature and of myself, I retired to my closet, and wrote a few lines to my uncle Harlowe, notwithstanding his prohibition; in order to get a reprieve from being carried away so soon as Thursday next, if I must go.\n",
      "Why should the poor girl be turned out of doors so suddenly, so disgracefully?\n",
      "One fortnight's respite is but a small favour for them to grant, except I am to be refused every thing I ask; but it is of the highest import to my peace of mind.\n",
      "I sent this down: my uncle was not gone: and he now stays to know the result of the question put to me in the enclosed answer which he has given to mind.\n",
      "If you comply not, go next Thursday to a house which is become strangely odious to you of late, whether you get ready to go or not.\n",
      "After a very little deliberation, I resolved to comply with this condition.\n",
      "I sent down the following to my uncle:\n",
      "\n",
      "HONOURED SIR,\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I see not what end the proposed condition can answer, I comply with it.\n",
      "I wish I could with every thing expected of me.\n",
      "If I must name the day, (a long day, I doubt, will not be permitted me,) let it be next Tuesday.\n",
      "The place either the ivy summer-house, or in the little parlour I used to be permitted to call mine.\n",
      "I thought it became my averseness to this meeting, to name a distant day: but I did not expect they would have complied with it.\n",
      "Yet have you seemed to consider the day as an evil day, and so put if far off.\n",
      "One hint I am to give you mean time.\n",
      "Weighed in this scale, what a profanation is this man guilty of!\n",
      "Not to take up my resolution beforehand!—That advice comes too late.\n",
      "That, I doubt, as they have managed it, in the sense they mean it, is as much out of my power, as the other.\n",
      "But write to one man, when I am designed for another!—What a shocking expression is that!\n",
      "If the irascible passions cannot be overcome, what opinion can we have of the person's power over those to which bad habit, joined to greater temptation, gives stronger force?\n",
      "He must have had pen, ink, and paper with him; for it was written in the coppice; with this circumstance: On one knee, kneeling with the other.\n",
      "It is very difficult for a good-natured young person to give a negative where it disesteems not.\n",
      "Excuse these grave reflections.\n",
      "What is now to become of me!—How shall I support this disappointment!—No new cause!—On one knee, kneeling with the other, I write!—My feet benumbed with midnight wanderings through the heaviest dews that ever fell: my wig and my linen dripping with the hoar frost dissolving on them!—Day but just breaking—Sun not risen to exhale—May it never rise again!—Unless it bring healing and comfort to a benighted soul!\n",
      "you would prevent my distraction, or, at least, distracted consequences, renew the promised hope!—My fate is indeed upon its crisis.\n",
      "Forgive me, dearest creature, forgive me!—I know I have written in too much anguish of mind!—Writing this, in the same moment that the just dawning light has imparted to me the heavy disappointment.\n",
      "(Gloomy is my soul; and all Nature around me partakes of my gloom!\n",
      "[Have patience with me, dearest creature!—I mean Solmes and your brother only.]\n",
      "But if, exerting your usual generosity, you will excuse and re appoint, may that God, whom you profess to serve, and who is the God of truth and of promises, protect and bless you, for both; and for restoring to himself, and to hope,\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ever-adoring, yet almost desponding, LOVELACE!\n",
      "I have, till very lately, been praised for mine; but it has always been by those who never gave me opportunity to return the compliment to them.\n",
      "You have hinted to me, that resentment is not natural to my temper, and that therefore it must soon subside: it may be so with respect to my relations; but not to Mr. Lovelace, I assure you.\n",
      "We cannot always answer for what we can do: but to convince you, that I can keep my above resolution, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, angry as my letter is, and three hours since it was written, I assure you, that I repent it not; nor will soften it, although I find it is not taken away.\n",
      "And yet I hardly ever before did any thing in anger, that I did not repent in half an hour; and question myself in less that that time, whether I was right or wrong.\n",
      "In this respite till Tuesday, I have a little time to look about me, as I may say, and to consider of what I have to do, and can do.\n",
      "A dreadful contention between parents and child!—Each hoping to leave the other without excuse, whatever the consequence may be.\n",
      "Something is strangely wrong somewhere!\n",
      "to make parents, the most indulgent till now, seem cruel in a child's eye; and a daughter, till within these few weeks, thought unexceptionably dutiful, appear, in their judgment, a rebel!—Oh!\n",
      "my ambitious and violent brother!\n",
      "My mother was sent for on Sunday night by her cousin Larkin, whom I mentioned in one of my former, and who was extremely earnest to see her.\n",
      "This poor woman was always afraid of death, and was one of those weak persons who imagine that the making of their will must be an undoubted forerunner of it.\n",
      "But go she would; and, what was worse, would make me go with her; and that, at an hour's warning; for she said nothing of it to me, till she was rising in the morning early, resolving to return again at night.\n",
      "But indeed I now-and-then, when she teases me with praises which Hickman cannot deserve, in return fall to praising those qualities and personalities in Lovelace, which the other never will have.\n",
      "She flies from me, at the long run.\n",
      "For, now I am rambling, let me tell you, that she does not much favour that;—for two reasons, I believe:—One, that I don't shew her all that passes between us; the other, that she thinks I harden your mind against your duty, as it is called.\n",
      "I have always your reproofs upon these occasions: in your late letters stronger than ever.\n",
      "That fiddling, parading fellow [you know who I mean] made us wait for him two hours, and I to go to a journey I disliked!\n",
      "I told him, that I supposed he was afraid, that the double solemnity in the case (that of the visit to a dying woman, and that of his own countenance) would give him the appearance of an undertaker; to avoid which, he ran into as bad an extreme, and I doubted would be taken for a mountebank.\n",
      "And though I should like it in him hereafter perhaps, yet I can't help despising him a little in my heart for it now.\n",
      "The poor man looked at my mother.\n",
      "She was so angry, (my airs upon it, and my opposition to the journey, have all helped,) that for half the way she would not speak to me.\n"

      "I doubted not, upon this, that her curiosity was owing to the orders she had received; and being afraid they would abridge me of my airings, if their suspicions were not obviated, it has ever since been my custom (among other contrivances) not only to leave my keys in the locks, but to employ the wench now-and-then in taking out my cloaths, suit by suit, on pretence of preventing their being rumpled or creased, and to see that the flowered silver suit did not tarnish: sometimes declaredly to give myself employment, having little else to do.\n",
      "I am afraid my brother and sister would not be sorry to drive me to take.\n",
      "My custom to be dressed for the day, as soon as breakfast is over, when I have had no household employments to prevent me, will make such a step (if I am forced to take it) less suspected.\n",
      "Does it not, moreover, manifest a firmness of mind, in an unhappy person, to keep hope alive?\n",
      "What a multitude of contrivances may not young people fall upon, if the mind be not engaged by acts of kindness and condescension!\n",
      "I am not used by my friends of late as I always used their servants.\n",
      "Mr. Solmes, (to expatiate on this low, but not unuseful subject,) in his more trifling solicitudes, would have had a sorry key-keeper in me.\n",
      "What I was principally leading to, was to tell you how ingenious I am in my contrivances and pretences to blind my gaoleress, and to take off the jealousy of her principals on my going down so often into the garden and poultry-yard.\n",
      "Sometimes I want air, and am better the moment I am out of my chamber.—Sometimes spirits; and then my bantams and pheasants or the cascade divert me; the former, by their inspiring liveliness; the latter, by its echoing dashes, and hollow murmurs.—Sometimes, solitude is of all things my wish; and the awful silence of the night, the spangled element, and the rising and setting sun, how promotive of contemplation!—Sometimes, when I intend nothing, and expect no letters, I am officious to take Betty with me; and at others, bespeak her attendance, when I know she is otherwise employed, and cannot give it me.\n",
      "How prompt a thing is will!—What impediments does dislike furnish!—How swiftly, through every difficulty, do we move with the one!—how tardily with the other!—every trifling obstruction weighing us down, as if lead were fastened to our feet!\n",
      "He may be mean enough perhaps, if ever I should put it into his power, to avenge himself for the trouble he has had with me.—But that now, I dare say, I never shall.\n",
      "The five guineas tied up in one corner of a handkerchief under the linen, I beg you will let pass as an acknowledgement for the trouble I give your trusty servant.\n",
      "I was going to put up what little money I have, and some of my ornaments; but they are portable, and I cannot forget them.\n",
      "Besides, should they (suspecting me) desire to see any of the jewels, and were I not able to produce them, it would amount to a demonstration of an intention which would have a guilty appearance to them.\n",
      "poor girl!)\n",
      "the poor young lover!—Ah!\n",
      "the poor simple girl!\n",
      "He appears to the people as a military man, in disguise, secreting himself on account of a duel fought in town; the adversary's life in suspense.\n",
      "Would not your brother, would not your uncles, tremble, if they knew how near them he is, as they pass to and fro?—I am told, he is resolved you shall not be carried to your uncle Antony's.—What can you do, with or without such an enterprising—\n",

      "* And now I see, his enemies are but too well warranted in their reports of him: and, if the ruin of this poor young creature be his aim, and if he had not known her but for his visits to Harlowe-place, I shall have reason to be doubly concerned for her; and doubly incensed against so vile a man.\n",

      "I think I hate him worse than I do Solmes himself.\n",
      "Of this one accusation, I think he must be acquitted; and I am sorry I was so forward in dispatching away my intelligence by halves.\n",
      "Mr. Lovelace and his friend, the poor man says, when they first came to his house, affected to appear as persons of low degree; but now he knows the one (but mentioned it in confidence) to be Colonel Barrow, the other Captain Sloane.\n",
      "So I made still further inquiry after his life and manner, and behaviour there, in hopes to find something bad: but all uniform!\n",
      "When I send you this letter of his, you will see how very humble he is: what acknowledgements of natural impatience: what confession of faults, as you prognosticated.\n",
      "I am indeed sorry he should be ill on my account; and I will allow, that the suspense he has been in for some time past, must have been vexatious enough to so impatient a spirit.\n",
      "But it is very difficult for persons, who would avoid running into one extreme, to keep clear of another.\n",
      "You will see, 'how passionately he presses me to oblige him with a few lines, before the interview between Mr. Solmes and me takes place, (if, as he says, it must take place,) to confirm his hope, that I have no view, in my present displeasure against him, to give encouragement to Solmes.\n",
      "'I tell him, that I have submitted to the interview with Mr. Solmes, purely as an act of duty, to shew my friends, that I will comply with their commands as far as I can; and that I hope, when Mr. Solmes himself shall see how determined I am, he will cease to prosecute a suit, in which it is impossible he should succeed with my consent.\n",
      "The pretence of corrupting other people's servants, by way of reprisal for the spies they have set upon him, I tell him, is a very poor excuse; and no more than an attempt to justify one meanness by another.\n",
      "'There is, I observe to him, a right and a wrong in every thing, let people put what glosses they please upon their action.\n",
      "'I inform him, that I have been lately made acquainted' [and so I have by Betty, and she by my brother] 'with the weak and wanton airs he gives himself of declaiming against matrimony.\n",
      "For I have but little hope, if carried thither, whether sensible or senseless, absolutely if I am left to the mercy of my brother and sister, but they will endeavour to force the solemn obligation upon me.\n",
      "Otherwise, were there but any prospect of avoiding this, by delaying (or even by taking things to make me ill, if nothing else would do,) till my cousin comes, I hope I should not think of leaving even my uncle's house.\n",
      "This looks as if they themselves expected no great matters from the Tuesday's conference which makes my heart flutter every time I think of it.\n",
      "I can't think Mr. Lovelace can be much more so; at least he cannot look angry, as my uncle, with his harder features, can.\n",
      "These sea-prospered gentlemen, as my uncle has often made me think, not used to any but elemental controul, and even ready to buffet that, bluster often as violently as the winds they are accustomed to be angry at.\n",
      "I believe Mr. Solmes will look as much like a fool as I shall do, if it be true, as my uncle Harlowe writes, and as Betty often tells me, that he is as much afraid of seeing me, as I am of seeing him.\n",
      "But you are the only person I ever heard of, who in such circumstances had not some faithful servant to trust little offices to.\n",
      "A poet, my dear, would not have gone to work for an Angelica, without giving her her Violetta, her Cleante, her Clelia, or some such pretty-named confidant—an old nurse at the least.\n",
      "Strange girl!\n",
      "cried my mother, displeased; but with a milder turn, ay, ay, Mr. Hickman, sit down by me: I have no such forbidding folly in my dress.\n",
      "He was highly obliged to dear Miss Harlowe, she would assure him; that she did say—\n",
      "\n",
      "But I asked him, if he had any news by his last letters from London?—A question which he always understands to be a subject changer; for otherwise I never put it.\n",
      "For men who have his views in their heads, do so parade it, so strut about, if a woman condescend to employ them in her affairs, that one has no patience with them.\n",
      "That you do not, is only owing to a little bashful struggle between you and yourself, as I may say.\n",
      "Indeed I am, and I will be, angry with you for it.\n",
      "If he should buy a ring, and marry a sorry body in the neighbourhood with the money, one would be loth, a twelvemonth hence, that the poor old fellow should think he had reason to wish the bounty never conferred.\n",
      "Not for this single instance of your generosity; since I am really angry with you for it; but for the benevolence exemplified in the whole tenor of your life and action; of which this is but a common instance.\n",
      "We had a conversation of near an hour before dinner: but, to my surprise, he waved every thing that would have led me to the subject I supposed he wanted to talk about.\n",
      "At last, I asked him, if it were not thought strange I should be so long absent from church?\n",
      "I was prodigiously disappointed; but supposing that he was thought too just a man to be made a judge of in this cause; I led no more to it: nor, when he was called down to dinner, did he take the least notice of leaving me behind him there.\n",
      "At last they came down the walk that I was coming up, hand-in-hand, lover-like.\n",
      "in a kinder voice than usual, said my sister, and stopped.—I stopped and courtesied low to her half-courtesy.—I think not, Sister, said I.\n",
      "Now, thought I, shall I have the subject of next Tuesday enforced upon me.\n",
      "I was impatient to see you.\n",
      "And let every past disagreeable thing be forgotten; as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "He understood me as beginning to hint at the disgrace of my confinement—No disgrace my dear can fall to your lot: your reputation is too well established.—I longed to see you, repeated me—I have seen nobody half so amiable since I saw you last.\n",
      "And again he kissed my cheek, my glowing cheek; for I was impatient, I was vexed, to be thus, as I thought, played upon: And how could I be thankful for a visit, that (it was now evident) was only a too humble artifice, to draw me in against the next Tuesday, or to leave me inexcusable to them all?\n",
      "And then my anger made me recollect the triumph in his and my sister's fondness for each other, as practised before me; and the mingled indignation flashing from their eyes, as arm-in-arm they spoke to me, and the forced condescension playing upon their lips, when they called me Clary, and Sister.\n",
      "You know, my dear, I never could bear to be dealt meanly with!—How—how can you, Sir!\n",
      "you my Papa-uncle—How can you, Sir!—The poor girl!—for I could not speak with connexion.\n",
      "with a stiff air.\n",
      "Madam!—How long are we to be at this distance, Clary?\n",
      "saucy little fool!—And away she flung.\n",
      "Yet Mr. Lovelace, the least of any man whose letters I have seen, runs into those elevated absurdities.\n",
      "'He regrets my indifference to him; which puts all the hope he has in my favour upon the shocking usage I receive from my friends.\n",
      "since being unable absolutely to vindicate himself, he has too much ingenuousness to attempt to do so: yet is struck dumb by my harsh construction, that his acknowledging temper is owing more to his carelessness to defend himself, than to his inclination to amend.\n",
      "'He believes I may be right (severely right, he calls it) in my judgment against making reprisals in the case of the intelligence he receives from my family: he cannot charge himself to be of a temper that leads him to be inquisitive into any body's private affairs; but hopes, that the circumstances of the case, and the strange conduct of my friends, will excuse him; especially when so much depends upon his knowing the movements of a family so violently bent, by measures right or wrong, to carry their point against me, in malice to him.\n",
      "For his part, he has not yet learned the difficult lesson of returning good for evil: and shall think himself the less encouraged to learn it by the treatment I have met with from the very persons who would trample upon him, as they do upon me, were he to lay himself under their feet.\n",
      "It is a subject, he says, that he has not of late treated so lightly.\n",
      "He owns it to be so trite, so beaten a topic with all libertines and witlings; so frothy, so empty, so nothing meaning, so worn-out a theme, that he is heartily ashamed of himself, ever to have made it his.\n",
      "He is extremely apprehensive of the meeting I am to have with Mr. Solmes to-morrow.\n",
      "'allotted this and that apartment in his house, for a nursery, and other offices.'\n",
      "Upon this confidence of Solmes, you will less wonder at that of Lovelace, 'in pressing me in the name of all his family, to escape from so determined a violence as is intended to be offered to me at my uncle's: that the forward contriver should propose Lord M.'s chariot and six to be at the stile that leads up to the lonely coppice adjoining to our paddock.\n",
      "Who can think of these things, and not be extremely miserable in her apprehensions!\n",
      "'Whatever be my usage, whatever shall be the result of the apprehended interview, I insist upon it that he presume not to offer violence to any of my friends: and express myself highly displeased, that he should presume upon such an interest in my esteem, as to think himself entitled to dispute my father's authority in my removal to my uncle's; although I tell him, that I will omit neither prayers nor contrivance, even to the making myself ill, to avoid going.'\n",
      "Hardly a wink have I slept, ruminating upon the approaching interview.\n",
      "Betty, in her alarming way, told me, I should have a lady to breakfast with me, whom I little expected; giving me to believe it was my mother.\n",
      "By this needless flutter on the approaching interview, when it is over you will judge of your other antipathies, and laugh at yourself for giving way to so apprehensive an imagination.\n",
      "Niceness, punctilio, mere punctilio, Niece!—Can you think that your appointment, (day, place, hour,) and knowing what the intent of it was, is to be interpreted away as a mere ceremony, and to mean nothing?—Let me tell you, my dear, your father, mother, uncles, every body, respect this appointment as the first act of your compliance with their wills: and therefore recede not, I desire you; but make a merit of what cannot be avoided.\n",
      "and he to be armed with such an expectation!—But it cannot be that he expects it, whatever others may do.—It is plain he cannot, by the fears he tell you all he shall have to see me.\n",
      "Does not this look like setting a high value upon yourself?—We all have exalted notions of your merit, Niece; but nevertheless, it would not be wrong, if you were to arrogate less to yourself; though more were to be your due than your friends attribute to you.\n",
      "I am sorry, Madam, it should be thought arrogance in me, to suppose I am not worthy of a better man than Mr. Solmes, both as to person and mind: and as to fortune, I thank God I despise all that can be insisted upon in his favour from so poor a plea.\n",
      "It was impossible I could think of such a strange expectation, upon a compliance made only to shew I would comply in all that was in my power to comply with.\n",
      "And see the reason why Dr. Lewen was admitted to visit me, yet forbore to enter upon a subject about which I thought he came to talk to me!—For it seems there was no occasion to dispute with me on the point I was to be supposed to have conceded to.—See, also, how unfairly my brother and sister must have represented their pretended kindness, when (though the had an end to answer by appearing kind) their antipathy to me seems to have been so strong, that they could not help insulting me by their arm-in-arm lover-like behaviour to each other; as my sister afterwards likewise did, when she came to borrow my Kempis.\n",
      "The end so unlikely to be answered by means so low!\n",
      "She could assure me, that it would be worse for me, if now I receded, than if I had never advanced.\n",
      "A poor low trick!\n",
      "I will leave you—\n",
      "\n",
      "Not in anger, I hope, Madam, interrupted I—all I meant was, to observe, that let the meeting issue as it may, and as it must issue, it cannot be a disappointment to any body.\n",
      "And so saying, down she hurried.\n",
      "In what way I shall resume, or when, is not left to me to conjecture; much less determine.\n",
      "I am excessively uneasy!—No good news from your mother, I doubt!—I will deposit thus far, for fear of the worst.\n"

      "Lord, Madam, cried Solmes, [all this time distorted into twenty different attitudes, as my brother and my uncle were blessing themselves, and speaking only to each other by their eyes, and by their working features; Lord, Madam,] what a construction is this!\n",
      "Excuse me, Sir, turning to my uncle—to you, as to my father's brother, I owe duty.\n",

      "And so, without any farther prohibition, I retired into the garden; and there casting myself upon the first seat, and throwing Betty's apron over my face, leaning against her side, my hands between hers, I gave way to a violent burst of grief, or passion, or both; which, as it seemed, saved my heart from breaking, for I was sensible of an immediate relief.\n",
      "Yes; she said, Mr. Solmes would have given up his claim to you; for he said, you hated him, and there were no hopes; and your mamma was willing he should; and to have you taken at your word, to renounce Mr. Lovelace and to live single.\n",
      "My mamma was for it too; for they heard all that passed between you and uncle Antony, and cousin James; saying, it was impossible to think of prevailing upon you to have Mr. Solmes.\n",
      "Uncle Harlowe seemed in the same way of thinking; at least, my mamma says he did not say any thing to the contrary.\n",
      "But your papa was immovable, and was angry at your mamma and mine upon it.—And hereupon your brother, your sister, and my uncle Antony, joined in, and changed the scene entirely.\n",
      "I do not know that, Miss: you will have good luck to avoid having him, by what I can find; for my mamma says, they are all now of one mind, herself excepted; and she is forced to be silent, your papa and brother are both so outrageous.\n",
      "Solmes was not worthy to buckle his shoes.\n",

      "Female accents I could distinguish the drowned ones to be.\n",
      "what a hard-hearted sex is the other!\n",
      "She has then, perhaps, a soul of the other sex in a body of ours.\n",
      "And then (as agreed upon I suppose) in came my uncle Antony, crediting Mr. Solmes with the words, Let me lead you in, my dear friend, having hold of his hand; while the new-made beau awkwardly followed, but more edgingly, as I may say, setting his feet mincingly, to avoid treading upon his leader's heels.\n",
      "Excuse me, my dear, this seeming levity; but those we do not love, appear in every thing ungraceful to us.\n",
      "And my uncle sat on the other side of me.\n",
      "My uncle could only be angry; and that he was before.\n",
      "Well, well, well, Mr. Solmes, said my uncle, no more of supplication.\n",

      "How they all gazed upon one another!—But could I be less peremptory before the man?\n",
      "And is a brother, an only brother, of so little consideration with you, as this comes to?\n",
      "Violent girl, however, he called me—Who, said he, who would have thought it of her?\n",
      "Then was I a rude, an ungrateful, and unworthy creature.\n",
      "Mr. Solmes made a still more grievous face than he had before.\n",
      "The door was endeavoured to be opened on the inside, which made my brother let go the key on a sudden; and I pressing against it, (all the time remaining on my knees,) fell flat on my face into the other parlour; however without hurting myself.\n",
      "What passed among them, I know not: but my brother came in by the time I had tolerably recovered myself, with a settled and haughty gloom upon his brow—Your father and mother command you instantly to prepare for your uncle Antony's.\n",
      "I beg to be indulged till next Monday at least.\n",
      "Excuse me, Brother.\n",
      "Have you any thing you are afraid should be seen by your mother?\n",
      "In came Miss Dolly Hervey: I am sorry, Madam, to be the messenger—but your mamma insists upon your sending up all the keys of your cabinet, library, and drawers.\n",
      "Tell my mother, that I yield them up to her commands: tell her, I make no conditions with my mother: but if she finds nothing she shall disapprove of, I beg that she will permit me to tarry here a few days longer.—Try, my Dolly, [the dear girl sobbing with grief;] try if your gentleness cannot prevail for me.\n",
      "She wept still more, and said, It is sad, very sad, to see matters thus carried!\n",
      "Don't pity me, my dear, said I.\n",
      "I went in again, and throwing myself upon the window-seat, wept bitterly.\n",
      "It can answer no good end.\n",
      "How happy it was they were disappointed!\n",
      "But being a little heavy (for it is now past two in the morning) I will lie down in my clothes, to indulge the kind summons, if it will be indulged.\n",
      "I am sorry for it, Madam.\n",
      "Sorry for it, child!—Why then so very obstinate?—Come, sit down, my dear.\n",
      "My uncle placed Mr. Solmes on the other side of me: himself over-against me, almost close to me.\n",
      "Was I not finely beset, my dear?\n",
      "Your brother, child, said my aunt, is too passionate—his zeal for your welfare pushes him on a little too vehemently.\n",
      "There is a reason that he should, said my aunt, as you will hear by-and by.—But I must tell you, first, that, thinking you was a little too angrily treated by your brother, your mother desired me to try what gentler means would do upon a spirit so generous as we used to think yours.\n",
      "It is not natural to her, man.\n",
      "I never will revive the remembrance of what is now so painful to me.\n",
      "O Madam, cried he, believe, believe, believe me, it is impossible.\n",
      "While you are single, I will hope.\n",
      "I must not slight them, Madam, because you slight me.\n",
      "Well, Niece, said my aunt, we must wave this subject, I find.\n",
      "If, Sir, it be suspected, that I have set my heart upon any other, why is Mr. Solmes to give himself any further trouble about me?\n",
      "He began to read; and there seemed to be a heavy load of charges in this letter against the poor criminal: but I stopped the reading of it, and said, It will not be my fault, if this vilified man be not as indifferent to me, as one whom I never saw.\n",
      "If my offer to live single be accepted, he shall be no more to me than this gentleman.\n",
      "And, besides, can any thing worse be said of Mr. Lovelace, than I have heard said for several months past?\n",
      "I see very plainly, girl, said my uncle, your prepossession, your fond prepossession, for the person of a man without morals.\n",
      "I think it is requisite, and as meritorious, in the one as in the other.\n",
      "He looked down; but was silent.\n",
      "Mr. Lovelace, for example, is said to be implacable, and to hate my friends: that does not make me value him the more: but give me leave to say, that they hate him as much.\n",
      "That's all I mean by it.\n",
      "The poor man's face was all this time overspread with confusion, twisted, as it were, and all awry, neither mouth nor nose standing in the middle of it.\n",
      "She but feebly blamed me, when she spoke, for not hearing what Mr. Solmes had to say.\n",
      "This was the strange speech he made at his entrance, his eyes flaming with anger; This prating girl, has struck you all dumb, I perceive.\n",
      "You yourself seem to favour too much the arrogance of her sex in her; otherwise she durst not have thus stopped her uncle's mouth by reflections upon him; as well as denied to hear a gentleman tell her the danger she is in from a libertine, whose protection, as she plainly hinted, she intends to claim against her family.\n",
      "Not more unbrotherly than all the rest of his conduct to me, of late, Madam, said I. I see by this specimen of his violence, how every body has been brought into his measures.\n",
      "Had I any the least apprehension of ever being in Mr. Solmes's power, this might have affected me.\n",
      "Less violence, Clary, said my uncle.\n",
      "But she left me not long at a loss—O thou perverse thing, said she [poking out her angry face at me, when they were all gone, but speaking spitefully low]—what trouble do you give to us all!\n",
      "You and my brother, Bella, said I, give trouble to yourselves; yet neither you nor he have any business to concern yourselves about me.\n"

      "This hint alarms me so much, that I shall instantly begin to conceal, in different places, pens, inks, and paper; and to deposit some in the ivy summer-house, if I can find a safe place there; and, at the worst, I have got a pencil of black, and another of red lead, which I use in my drawings; and my patterns shall serve for paper, if I have no other.\n",

      "About an hour ago, I deposited my long letter to you; as also, in the usual place, a billet to Mr. Lovelace, lest his impatience should put him upon some rashness; signifying, in four lines, 'That the interview was over; and that I hoped my steady refusal of Mr. Solmes would discourage any further applications to me in his favour.'\n",

      "Can he say any thing of us more disrespectful than we say of him?—And as to the suggestion, so often repeated, that he will make a bad husband, Is it possible for him to use a wife worse than I am used; particularly by my brother and sister?\n",

      "What a construction does your lively wit put upon the admiration Mr. Solmes expresses of you!—Passionate as you were yesterday, and contemptuously as you treated him, he dotes upon you for the very severity by which he suffers.\n",

      "MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY, FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just returned from depositing the letter I so lately finished, and such of Mr. Lovelace's letters as I had not sent you.\n",
      "My long letter I found remaining there—so you will have both together.\n",
      "I found in the usual place another letter from this diligent man: and, by its contents, a confirmation that nothing passes in this house but he knows it; and that almost as soon as it passes.\n",
      "What a dangerous enterpriser, however, is this man!\n",
      "'He begs a few lines from me by way of answer to this letter, either this evening, or to-morrow morning.\n",
      "You will see by this abstract, as well by his letter preceding this, (for both run in the same strain,) how strangely forward the difficulty of my situation has brought him in his declarations and proposals; and in his threatenings too: which, but for that, I would not take from him.\n",
      "I struck into an oblique path, and got behind the yew-hedge, seeing my sister appear; and there concealed myself till they were gone past me.\n",
      "My poor mother keeps her chamber—should she be worse, I should have an additional unhappiness, in apprehension that my reputed undutifulness had touched her heart.\n",
      "You cannot imagine what my emotions were behind the yew-hedge, on seeing my father so near me.\n",
      "'Let her not inquire after the disorders she occasions,' was her harsh answer.\n",
      "Very, very hard, my dear!\n",
      "Indeed it is very hard.\n",
      "A colicky disorder, to which she is too subject.\n",
      "It is hoped it is gone off—God send it may!—Every evil that happens in this house is owing to me!\n",
      "Possibly this is said by order, to make me go with less reluctance to my uncle's.\n",
      "So, my dear, if I do not resolve upon something soon, I shall neither be able to avoid the intended evil, nor have it in my power to correspond with you.\n",
      "I will go down, though 'tis almost dark, on pretence of getting a little air and composure.\n",
      "I know not what I shall do!—All is so strangely busy!—Doors clapt to—going out of one apartment, hurryingly, as I may say, into another.\n",
      "It may come home to me when I least expect it.'\n",
      "Probably they arose from the information Mr. Lovelace says he has secretly permitted them to have (from this vile double-faced agent, I suppose!)\n",
      "How justly, if so, may this exasperate them!—How am I driven to and fro, like a feather in the wind, at the pleasure of the rash, the selfish, the headstrong!\n",
      "and when I am as averse to the proceedings of the one, as I am to those of the other!\n",
      "For although I was induced to carry on this unhappy correspondence, as I think I ought to call it, in hopes to prevent mischief; yet indiscreet measures are fallen upon by the rash man, before I, who am so much concerned in the event of the present contentions, can be consulted: and between his violence on one hand, and that of my relations on the other, I find myself in danger from both.\n",
      "what is worldly wisdom but the height of folly!—I, the meanest, at least youngest, of my father's family, to thrust myself in the gap between such uncontroulable spirits!—To the intercepting perhaps of the designs of Providence, which may intend to make those hostile spirits their own punishers.—If so, what presumption!—Indeed, my dear friend, I am afraid I have thought myself of too much consequence.\n",
      "If I am prevented depositing this and the enclosed, (as I intend to try to do, late as it is,) I will add to it as occasion shall offer.\n",
      "Mean time, believe me to be\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ever-affectionate and grateful CL.\n",
      "Under the superscription, written with a pencil, after she went down.\n",
      "It behoves me to account to my dear friend, in her present unhappy situation, for every thing that may have the least appearance of negligence or remissness on my part.\n",
      "Mr. Hunt's house, you know, lies wide from Harlowe-place.\n",
      "Robin but just saved his time; and returned not till it was too late to send him again.\n",
      "I was not a quarter dressed; and only slipt on my morning sack; proceeding no further till I had read them all through, long as they are: and yet I often stopped to rave aloud (though by myself) at the devilish people you have to deal with.\n",
      "Other people!—How I hate the poor words, where friendship is concerned, and where the protection to be given may be of so much consequence to a friend, and of so little detriment to one's self?\n",
      "I could tell what to advise any other person in the world to do but you.\n",
      "So much expected from you!—Such a shining light!—Your quitting your father's house, and throwing yourself into the protection of a family, however honourable, that has a man in it, whose person, parts, declarations, and pretensions, will be thought to have engaged your warmest esteem;—methinks I am rather for advising that you should get privately to London; and not to let either him, or any body else but me, know where you are, till your cousin Morden comes.\n",
      "To obtain this time, you must palliate a little, and come into some seeming compromise, if you cannot do otherwise.\n",
      "Driven as you are driven, it will be strange if you are not obliged to part with a few of your admirable punctilio's.\n",
      "I am extremely mortified and disappointed.\n",
      "But, besides the narrow argument of embroiling ourselves with other people's affairs, as above-mentioned, she will have it, that it is your duty to comply.\n",
      "A little interruption.—What is breakfast to the subject I am upon?\n",
      "It will enable me to perform what is no more than a duty in serving and comforting a dear and worthy friend, who labours under undeserved oppression: and you will ennoble, as I may say, your Anna Howe, if you allow her to be your companion in affliction.\n",
      "I must repeat what I have often said, that the authors of your persecutions would not have presumed to set on foot their selfish schemes against you, had they not depended upon the gentleness of your spirit; though now, having gone so far, and having engaged Old AUTHORITY in it, [chide me if you will!]\n",
      "I shall be impatient to hear whether they will attempt to carry you to your uncle's.\n",
      "I remember, that Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff reported of Lovelace, that he had six or seven companions as bad as himself; and that the country was always glad when they left it.\n",
      "Yet too much love, I think, is as bad as too little.\n",
      "But I am but a daughter!—Yet I thought I was not quite so powerless when I was set upon carrying a point, as I find myself to be.\n",
      "Whichsoever of these you make choice of, you will have this plea, both to yourself, and to the world, that you are concluded by the same uniform principle that has governed your whole conduct, ever since the contention between Lovelace and your brother has been on foot: that is to say, that you have chosen a lesser evil, in hopes to prevent a greater.\n",
      "If I had, I should not have dared to look up to any body with the expectation of protection or assistance, nor to you for excuse of the trouble I give you.\n",
      "But nevertheless we should not be angry at a person's not doing that for ourselves, or for our friend, which she thinks she ought not to do; and which she has it in her option either to do, or to let it alone.\n",
      "Indeed, my dear love, [permit me to be very serious,] I am afraid I am singled out (either for my own faults, or for the faults of my family, or perhaps for the faults of both) to be a very unhappy creature!—signally unhappy!\n",
      "For see you not how irresistible the waves of affliction come tumbling down upon me?\n",
      "If I am to be singled out to be the punisher of myself and family, who so lately was the pride of it, pray for me, my dear, that I may not be left wholly to myself; and that I may be enabled to support my character, so as to be justly acquitted of wilful and premeditated faults.\n",
      "My afflictions are too sharp to last long.\n",
      "And all by the instigation of a selfish brother, and envious sister—\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me stop: let me reflect!—Are not these suggestions the suggestions of the secret pride I have been censuring?\n",
      "Then, already so impatient!\n",
      "yet 'tis hard, 'tis very hard, to subdue an embittered spirit!—in the instant of its trial too!—O my cruel brother!—but now it rises again.—I will lay down a pen I am so little able to govern.—And I will try to subdue an impatience, which (if my afflictions are sent me for corrective ends) may otherwise lead me into still more punishable errors.—\n",
      "\n",
      "I will return to a subject, which I cannot fly from for ten minutes together—called upon especially, as I am, by your three alternatives stated in the conclusion of your last.\n",
      "What a wretch must I be, if, for one moment only, I could lend an ear to such a proposal as this!—I, to be the occasion of making such a mother's (perhaps shortened) life unhappy to the last hour of it!—Ennoble you, my dear creature!\n",
      "Your third alternative, to meet and marry Mr. Lovelace directly; a man with whose morals I am far from being satisfied—a step, that could not be taken with the least hope of ever obtaining pardon from or reconciliation with any of my friends; and against which a thousand objections rise in my mind—that is not to be thought of.\n",
      "If, my dear, you can procure a vehicle for us both, you can perhaps procure one for me singly: but can it be done without embroiling yourself with your mother, or her with our family?—Be it coach, chariot, chaise, wagon, or horse, I matter not, provided you appear not to have a hand in my withdrawing.\n",
      "They must be thrust on in the wood-house; where I can put them on; and then slide down from the bank, that separates the wood-yard from the green lane.\n",
      "But, alas!\n",
      "my dear, this, even this alternative, is not without difficulties, which, to a spirit so little enterprising as mine, seem in a manner insuperable.\n",

      "This alarming hurry I mentioned under my date of last night, and Betty's saucy dark hints, come out to be owing to what I guessed they were; that is to say, to the private intimation Mr. Lovelace contrived our family should have of his insolent resolution [insolent I must call it] to prevent my being carried to my uncle's.\n",

      "This was the purport of what I wrote; and down into the garden I slid with it in the dark, which at another time I should not have had the courage to do; and deposited it, and came up again unknown to any body.\n",
      "My mind so dreadfully misgave me when I returned, that, to divert in some measure my increasing uneasiness, I had recourse to my private pen; and in a very short time ran this length.\n",
      "Yet he owns he spends three parts of his days, and has done for this fortnight past, in loitering about sometimes in one disguise, sometimes in another, besides the attendance given by his trusty servant when he himself is not in waiting, as he calls it.\n",
      "But these strange forebodings!—Yet I can, if you advise, cause the chariot he shall bring with him, to carry me directly to town, whither in my London scheme, if you were to approve it, I had proposed to go: and this will save you the trouble of procuring for me a vehicle; as well as prevent any suspicion from your mother of your contributing to my escape.\n",
      "My aunt Hervey, who is a very early riser, was walking in the garden (Betty attending her, as I saw from my window this morning) when I arose: for after such a train of fatigue and restless nights, I had unhappily overslept myself: so all I durst venture upon, was, to step down to my poultry-yard, and deposit mine of yesterday, and last night.\n",
      "This prevents me from going to resume my letter, as I think still to do; and hope it will not be too late.\n",
      "I said, I had unhappily overslept myself: I went to bed about half an hour after two.\n",
      "'Methought my brother, my uncle Antony, and Mr. Solmes, had formed a plot to destroy Mr. Lovelace; who discovering it, and believing I had a hand in it, turned all his rage against me.\n",
      "I awoke in a cold sweat, trembling, and in agonies; and still the frightful images raised by it remain upon my memory.\n",
      "The man, my dear, has got the letter!—What a strange diligence!\n",
      "And yet is there any other way than to do as I have done, if I would avoid Solmes?\n",
      "That, of itself, is an indication that I have done wrong, and am afraid of hearing the truth—O tell me (but yet do not tell me) if I have done wrong!\n",
      "She began what she had to say with letting me know that my friends are all persuaded that I still correspond with Mr. Lovelace; as is plain, she said, by hints and menaces he throws out, which shew that he is apprized of several things that have passed between my relations and me, sometimes within a very little while after they have happened.\n",
      "It was but too natural, my aunt said, for my friends to suppose that he had his intelligence (part of it at least) from me; who, thinking yourself hardly treated, might complain of it, if not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing; for they knew Miss Howe spoke as freely of them, as they could do of Mr. Lovelace; and must have the particulars she spoke of from somebody who knew what was done here.\n",
      "I perceive you are going to speak with warmth, proceeded she: [and so I was] for my own part I am sure, you would not write any thing, if you do write, to inflame so violent a spirit.—But this is not the end of my present visit.\n",
      "Your mother desires me to tell you, that if you will give her the least hopes of a dutiful compliance, she will be willing to see you in her closet just now, while your father is gone to take a walk in the garden.\n",
      "said I—I am tired with making declarations and with pleadings on this subject; and had hoped, that my resolution being so well known, I should not have been further urged upon it.\n",
      "You mistake the purport of my present visit, Miss: [looking gravely]—Heretofore you have been desired and prayed to obey and oblige your friends.\n",
      "Will you go down, Miss Clary, or will you not?\n",
      "It is cruel to press this matter so often upon me.—I never will have that man.\n",
      "Down she went with displeasure.\n",
      "I am amazed that they are not!—So little variation!\n",
      "I will go down and deposit this; for Betty has seen I have been writing.\n",
      "The saucy creature took a napkin, and dipt it in water, and with a fleering air, here, Miss; holding the wet corner to me.\n",
      "The dreadful thing is, that comparing what he writes from his intelligencer of what is designed against me (though he seems not to know the threatened day) with what my aunt and Betty assure me of, there can be no hope for me, but that I must be Solmes's wife, if I stay here.\n",
      "I should have gained time, at least, by it.\n",
      "However, I have replied to the following effect: 'That although I had given him room to expect that I would put myself into the protection of one of the ladies of his family; yet as I have three days to come, between this and Monday, and as I still hope that my friends will relent, or that Mr. Solmes will give up a point they will find impossible to carry; I shall not look upon myself as absolutely bound by the appointment: and expect therefore, if I recede, that I shall not again be called to account for it by him.\n",
      "I am really ill.\n",
      "I was used to make the best of any little accidents that befel me, for fear of making my then affectionate friends uneasy: but now I shall make the worst of my indisposition, in hopes to obtain a suspension of the threatened evil of Wednesday next.\n",
      "I was in the ivy summer-house, and came out shivering with cold, as if aguishly affected.\n",
      "Perverseness is a bracer to a love-sick girl, and more effectual than the cold bath to make hardy, although the constitution be ever so tender.'\n",
      "This was said by a cruel brother, and heard said by the dearer friends of one, for whom, but a few months ago, every body was apprehensive at the least blast of wind to which she exposed herself!\n",
      "Nothing of this nature is lost by her repetition: even the very air with which she repeats what she hears said, renders it unnecessary to ask, who spoke this or that severe thing.\n",
      "When this awful court is assembled, the poor prisoner is to be brought in, supported by Mrs. Norton; who is to be first tutored to instruct me in the duty of a child; which it seems I have forgotten.\n",
      "But what condescensions, even from my father, can induce me to make such a sacrifice as is expected from me?\n",
      "Indeed I expected that my trials would not be at an end till he had admitted me into his awful presence.\n",
      "I said, I was not well: that the very apprehensions of these trials were already insupportable to me; and would increase upon me, as the time approached; and I was afraid I should be extremely ill.\n",
      "[This, my dear Miss Howe, is an aspersion to fasten hypocrisy and contempt upon me: my brother's or sister's aspersion!—I am not capable of arts so low.]\n",
      "But the moment you are down with your poultry, or advancing upon your garden-walk, and, as you imagine, out of every body's sight, it is seem how nimbly you trip along; and what an alertness governs all your motions.\n",
      "I should hate myself, said I, were I capable of such poor artifices as these.\n",
      "But there is violence enough offered, and threatened, to affect my health; and so it will be found, without my needing to have recourse to any other, or to artifice either.\n",
      "I was dumb.\n",
      "And yet, my aunt told me, that the last part was what took in my mother: who had, till that last expedient was found out, insisted, that her child should not be married, if, through grief or opposition, she should be ill, or fall into fits.\n",
      "This intended violence my aunt often excused, by the certain information they pretended to have, of some plots or machinations, that were ready to break out, from Mr. Lovelace:* the effects of which were thus cunningly to be frustrated.\n",
      "* It may not be amiss to observe in this place, that Mr.\n",
      "     Lovelace artfully contrived to drive the family on, by\n",
      "     permitting his and their agent Leman to report machinations,\n",
      "     which he had neither intention nor power to execute.\n",
      "And if any mischief ensue from Mr. Lovelace's rage and disappointment, will it not lie at my door?—Yet, he offers so fair!—Yet, on the other hand, to incur the censure of the world, as a giddy creature—but that, as he hints, I have already incurred—What can I do?—Oh!\n",
      "'These several measures he proposes to my choice; as it was unlikely, he says, that he could procure, in the time, a letter from Lady Betty, under her own hand, to invite me in form to her house, unless he had been himself to go to that lady for it; which, at this critical juncture, while he is attending my commands, is impossible.\n",
      "But that nevertheless, as to the world's opinion, it is impossible to imagine that the behaviour of my relations to me has not already brought upon my family those free censures which they deserve, and caused the step which I am so scrupulous about taking, to be no other than the natural and expected consequence of their treatment of me.'\n",
      "Indeed, I am afraid all this is true: and it is owing to some little degree of politeness, that Mr. Lovelace does not say all he might on this subject: for I have no doubt that I am the talk, and perhaps the bye-word of half the county.\n",
      "I wish, if ever I am to be considered as one of the eminent family this man is allied to, some of them do not think the worse of me for the disgrace I have received.\n",
      "You see how much this harsh, this cruel treatment from my own family has humbled me!\n",
      "I tell him, 'That I shall not try to bring any other clothes with me than those I shall have on; and those but my common wearing-apparel; lest I should be suspected.\n",
      "You must think, my dear, that this unhappy force upon me, and this projected flight, make it necessary for me to account to him much sooner than I should otherwise choose to do, for every part of my conduct.\n",
      "'It is not to be expected, I tell him, that your mother will embroil herself, or suffer you or Mr. Hickman to be embroiled, on my account: and as to his proposal of my going to London, I am such an absolute stranger to every body there, and have such a bad opinion of the place, that I cannot by any means think of going thither; except I should be induced, some time hence, by the ladies of his family to attend them.\n",
      "This, my dear, I the less scrupled to write, as it might qualify him to bear such a disappointment, should I give it him; he having, besides, behaved so very unexceptionably when he surprised me some time ago in the lonely wood-house.\n",
      "my deep concern for being forced to take a step so disagreeable, and so derogatory to my honour.\n",
      "I added, by way of postscript, 'That their suspicions seeming to increase, I advise him to contrive to send or some to the usual place, as frequently as possible, in the interval of time till Monday morning ten or eleven o'clock; as something may possibly happen to make me alter my mind.'\n",
      "O my dear Miss Howe!—what a sad, sad thing is the necessity, forced upon me, for all this preparation and contrivance!—But it is now too late!—But how!—Too late, did I say?—What a word is that!—What a dreadful thing, were I to repent, to find it to be too late to remedy the apprehended evil!\n",
      "A strange diligence in this man!—He says, he almost lives upon the place; and I think so too.\n",
      "It is a wonder, nevertheless, that he has not been seen by some of our tenants: for it is impossible that any disguise can hide the gracefulness of his figure.\n",
      "Then they are less watchful, I believe, over my garden-walks, and my poultry-visits, depending, as my aunt hinted, upon the bad character they have taken so much pains to fasten upon Mr. Lovelace.\n",
      "Were it not for these two, they would not surely have used me as they have done; and at the same time left me the opportunities which I have several times had, to get away, had I been disposed to do so:* and, indeed, their dependence on both these motives would have been well founded, had they kept but tolerable measures with me.\n",
      "* They might, no doubt, make a dependence upon the reasons\n",
      "     she gives: but their chief reliance was upon the vigilance\n",
      "     of their Joseph Leman; little imagining what an implement he\n",
      "     was of Mr. Lovelace.\n"

      "And indeed I am afraid of giving you my advice at all, or telling you what I should do in your case (supposing you will still refuse my offer; finding too what you have been brought or rather driven to without it); lest any evil should follow it: in which case, I should never forgive myself.\n",

      "Then I will, for the last time, go to the usual place, in hopes to find that he has got my letter.\n",
      "That will break the ice, as I may say, and save me much circumlocution and reasoning: and a steady adherence to that my written mind is all that will be necessary.—The interview must be as short as possible; for should it be discovered, it would furnish a new and strong pretence for the intended evil of Wednesday next.\n",

      "They cannot, however, say worse of me than I will of myself.\n",
      "If any thing can arise from the account I am going to give you, for extenuation of my fault (for that is all a person can hope for, who cannot excuse herself) I know I may expect it from your friendship, though not from the charity of any other: since by this time I doubt not every mouth is opened against me; and all that know Clarissa Harlowe condemn the fugitive daughter.\n",
      "I can choose whether I will or will not put my hand to them; hard as it will be to refuse if my father and mother propose, if I made compulsion necessary, to go to my uncle's themselves in order to be out of the way of my appeals?\n",
      "And finally, if nothing else will do, nor procure me delay, I can plead scruples of conscience, and even pretend prior obligation; for, my dear, I have give Mr. Lovelace room to hope (as you will see in one of my letters in your hands) that I will be no other man's while he is single, and gives me not wilful and premeditated cause of offence against him; and this in order to rein-in his resentment on the declared animosity of my brother and uncles to him.\n",
      "I told you, my dear, that I would not spare myself: and I enumerate these particulars as so many arguments to condemn the actions I have been so unhappily betrayed into.\n",
      "God forgive me, if I judge too harshly of their views!—But if I do not, it follows, that they laid a wicked snare for me; and that I have been caught in it.—And now they triumph, if they can triumph, in the ruin of a sister, who never wished or intended to hurt them!\n",
      "As the above kind of reasoning had lessened my apprehensions as to the Wednesday, it added to those I had of meeting Mr. Lovelace—now, as it seemed, not only the nearest, but the heaviest evil; principally indeed because nearest; for little did I dream (foolish creature that I was, and every way beset!)\n",
      "an obliging temper is a very dangerous temper!—By endeavouring to gratify others, it is evermore disobliging itself!\n",
      "When the bell rang to call the servants to dinner, Betty came to me and asked, if I had any commands before she went to hers; repeating her hint, that she should be employed; adding, that she believed it was expected that I should not come up till she came down, or till I saw my aunt or Miss Hervey.\n",
      "I asked her some questions about the cascade, which had been out of order, and lately mended; and expressed a curiosity to see how it played, in order to induce her [how cunning to cheat myself, as it proved!]\n",
      "She could hardly have got into the house when I heard the first signal—O how my heart fluttered!—but no time was to be lost.\n",
      "My heart seemed convulsed; and I trembled so, that I should hardly have kept my feet, had he not supported me.\n",
      "Recovering my spirits a little, as he kept drawing me after him, O Mr. Lovelace, said I, I cannot go with you—indeed I cannot—I wrote you word so—let go my hand, and you shall see my letter.\n",
      "I have been watched, my dearest life, said he, half out of breath—I have been watched in every step I took: and my trusty servant has been watched too, ever since Saturday; and dared not to come near your wall.\n",
      "What is it you mean, Sir?—Let go my hand: for I tell you [struggling vehemently] that I will sooner die than go with you.\n",
      "I had not met you, but for fear you would have been guilty of some rashness—and, once more, I will not go—What mean you?—striving with all my force to get from him.\n",
      "I shall gain time at least.\n",
      "It is plain you have not a hope beyond that—it is plain you have not, by putting all upon that precarious issue.\n",
      "I can convince you that it will be more than a risque if you go back, that you will on Wednesday next be Solmes's wife.—Prevent, therefore, now that it is in your power to prevent, the fatal mischief that will follow such a dreadful certainty.\n",
      "When has that been questionable?\n",
      "Yet what stead has either your prudence or your duty stood you in, with people so strangely determined?\n",
      "And then he pathetically enumerated the different instances of the harsh treatment I had met with; imputing all to the malice and caprice of a brother, who set every body against him: and insisting, that I had no other way to bring about a reconciliation with my father and uncles, than by putting myself out of the power of my brother's inveterate malice.\n",
      "Urge me no more, Mr. Lovelace, I conjure you.\n",
      "You yourself have given me a hint, which I will speak plainer to, than prudence, perhaps, on any other occasion, would allow.\n",
      "Whither, Sir, do you draw me?—Leave me this moment—Do you seek to keep me till my return shall grow dangerous or impracticable?\n",
      "Let me go back, then—let me, before it is too late, go back, that it may not be worse for both—What mean you by this forcible treatment?\n",
      "I had already staid too long.\n",
      "Nay, be not surprised, Madam.\n",
      "You shall see what I can further bear for your sake—and let us both see, if expostulation, and the behaviour of a gentleman to them, will not procure me the treatment due to a gentleman from them.\n",
      "Had he offered to draw his sword upon himself, I was prepared to have despised him for supposing me such a poor novice, as to be intimidated by an artifice so common.\n",
      "But this resolution, uttered with so serious an air, of accompanying me in to my friends, made me gasp with terror.\n",
      "What mean you, Mr. Lovelace?\n",
      "Excuse me, Madam!\n",
      "I beg you to excuse me.\n",
      "I have long enough skulked like a thief about these lonely walls—long, too long, have I borne the insults of your brother, and other of your relations.\n",
      "Absence but heightens malice.\n",
      "I am desperate.\n",
      "I have encouraged virulence by my tameness.—Yet tame I will still be.\n",
      "What can you mean, Mr. Lovelace?—said I—Would you thus expose yourself?\n",
      "O my dearest creature, do these preparations mean only a trial?\n",
      "You know not, Sir, were the worst to be intended, and weak as you think me, what a spirit I have: you know not what I can do, and how I can resist when I think myself meanly or unreasonably dealt with: nor do you know what I have already suffered, what I have already borne, knowing to whose unbrotherly instigations all is to be ascribed—\n",
      "\n",
      "I may expect all things, Madam, interrupted he, from the nobleness of your mind.\n",
      "But your spirits may fail you.\n",
      "What may not be apprehended from the invincible temper of a father so positive, to a daughter so dutiful?—Fainting will not save you: they will not, perhaps, be sorry for such an effect of their barbarity.\n",
      "Must not all, the dreadful all follow, that is torture to my heart but to think of?\n",
      "I should think very hardly of him, if he sought to detain me longer.\n",
      "This frighted me so, that I thought I should have sunk down at his feet.\n"

      "Now behind me, now before me, now on this side, now on that, turned I my affrighted face, in the same moment; expecting a furious brother here, armed servants there, an enraged sister screaming, and a father armed with terror in his countenance more dreadful than even the drawn sword which I saw, or those I apprehended.\n",

      "Perhaps, in struggling to prevail upon the dear creature, I may have an opportunity to strike the door hard with my elbow, or heel, to confirm you—then you are to make a violent burst against the door, as if you would break it open, drawing backward and forward the bolt in a hurry: then, with another push, but with more noise than strength, lest the lock give way, cry out (as if you saw some of the family) Come up, come up, instantly!—Here they are!\n",

      "I have reason to think, there were other horsemen at his devotion; three or four different persons, above the rank of the servants, galloping by us now-and-then, on each side of the chariot: but he took no notice of them; and I had too much grief, mingled with indignation, notwithstanding all his blandishments, to ask any questions about them, or any thing else.\n",

      "So, my dear, your frank, your open-hearted friend, was forced to countenance this tale; which indeed suited me the better, because I was unable for some time to talk, speak, or look up; and so my dejection, and grief, and silence, might very well pass before the gentlewoman and her niece who attended me, as a fit of sullenness.\n",

      "I am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you imagine had I staid.\n",
      "If personal considerations had principal weight with me, either in Solmes's disfavour, or in your favour, I shall despise myself: if you value yourself upon them, in preference to the person of the poor Solmes, I shall despise you!\n",
      "You may glory in your fancied merits in getting me away: but the cause of your glory, I tell you plainly, is my shame.\n",
      "But here, Sir, like the first pair, (I, at least, driven out of my paradise,) are we recriminating.\n",
      "No more shall you need to tell me of your sufferings, and your merits!\n",
      "If I thought there were, I would not sit with you here, in a public inn, I assure you, although cheated hither, as far as I know, by methods (you must excuse me, Sir) which, but to suspect, will hardly let me have patience either with you or with myself—but no more of this, just now: Let me, I beseech you, good Sir, bowing [I was very angry!]\n",
      "Let you know (and with that air, too, charming, though grievous to my heart!)\n",
      "His motion was so sudden, that I was not aware of it.\n",
      "It would have looked affected to be very angry; yet I could not be pleased, considering this as a leading freedom, from a spirit so audacious and encroaching: and he might see, that I was not.\n",
      "And now let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful uneasiness, which gives me to apprehend too much for my jealous love to bear; and it shall be my whole endeavour to deserve your favour, and to make you the happiest woman in the world; as I shall be the happiest of men.\n",
      "I looked over my little stock of money; and found it to be no more than seven guineas and some silver: the rest of my stock was but fifty guineas, and that five more than I thought it was, when my sister challenged me as to the sum I had by me:* and those I left in my escritoire, little intending to go away with him.\n",
      "Indeed my case abounds with a shocking number of indelicate circumstances.\n",
      "Among the rest, I was forced to account to him, who knew I could have no clothes but what I had on, how I came to have linen with me (for he could not but know I sent for it); lest he should imagine I had an early design to go away with him, and made that part of the preparation.\n",
      "I could now, I think, give twenty reasons stronger than any I have heretofore mentioned, why women of the least delicacy should never think of incurring the danger and the disgrace of taking the step I have been drawn in to take, but with horror and aversion; and why they should look upon the man who should tempt them to it, as the vilest and most selfish of seducers.\n",
      "My choice was, to go to a private lodging, and for him to be at a distance from me: at least, till I heard how things were taken by my friends: for that, although I had but little hopes of a reconciliation as it was; yet if they knew I was in his protection, or in that of any of his friends, (which would be looked upon as the same thing,) there would not be room for any hopes at all.\n",

      "Expect therefore a faint sketch of her admirable person with her dress.\n",
      "I begged, I prayed; on my knees, yet in vain, I begged and prayed her to answer her own appointment: and had I not happily provided for such a struggle, knowing whom I had to deal with, I had certainly failed in my design; and as certainly would have accompanied her in, without thee and thy brethren: and who knows what might have been the consequence?\n",
      "I believe, Jack, my dogs conclude me mad: for here has one of them popt in, as if to see what ailed me, or whom I had with me.\n",
      "Thou shalt have cause, if that come to pass, which may come to pass (for why wouldst thou put off marriage to so long a day, as till thou hadst reason to be convinced of my reformation, dearest?)\n",

      "Then thou knowest what a false little rogue she has been.\n",
      "How little conscience she has made of disappointing me.\n",
      "Then, I fancy by her circumspection, and her continual grief, that she expects some mischief from me.\n",

      "Is it likely that he and Bell would have given way to your restoration to favour, supposing it in their power to hinder it, on any other terms than those their hearts had been so long set upon?\n",
      "Your aunt and all your family were accordingly alarmed by this fellow—evidently when too late for pursuit.\n",
      "And having heard the man's tale upon the spot, a general lamentation, a mutual upbraiding, and rage, and grief, were echoed from the different persons, according to their different tempers and conceptions.\n",
      "But your mother and your aunt Hervey dissuaded them from it, for fear of adding evil to evil; not doubting but Lovelace had taken measures to support himself in what he had done; and especially when the servant declared, that he saw you run with him as fast as you could set foot to the ground; and that there were several armed men on horseback at a small distance off.\n",
      "My mother's absence was owing to her suspicion, that the Knolly's were to assist in our correspondence.\n",
      "And they have promised, that no more letters shall be left there, without her knowledge.\n",
      "She had not best Harlowe me at this rate—I won't bear it.\n",
      "Yet I see your difficulties.—But, if he do not offer to abuse your confidence, I would have you seem at least to place some in him.\n",
      "Mean time I have sixty guineas at your service.\n",
      "As they believe you went away by your own consent, they are, it seems, equally surprised and glad that you have left your jewels and money behind you, and have contrived for clothes so ill.\n",
      "Very little likelihood this shews of their answering your requests.\n",
      "As you may depend upon all the little spiteful things they can offer, instead of sending what you write for, pray accept the sum that I tender.\n",
      "And if I find this, I shall not know how to reconcile it with your delicacy in other respects.\n",
      "If any thing occur that you would tell me of if I were present, fail not to put it down in writing, although from your natural diffidence, it should not appear to you altogether so worthy of your pen, or my knowing.\n",
      "I repeat, therefore, that were I you, I would at least seem to place some confidence in him.\n",
      "And they vow, that they will never hearken to any terms of accommodation that shall come from that quarter; for I dare aver, that your brother and sister will not let them cool—at least, till their uncles have made such dispositions, and perhaps your father too, as they would have them make.\n",
      "Had I not to console myself, that my error is not owing to wicked precipitation, I should be the most miserable of all creatures.\n",
      "As it is, I am enough punished in the loss of my character, more valuable to me than my life; and in the cruel doubts and perplexities which, conflicting with my hopes, and each getting the victory by turns, harrow up my soul between them.\n",
      "I think, however, that you should obey your mother, and decline a correspondence with me; at least for the present.\n",
      "Yet, as to this correspondence, What hurt could arise from it, if your mother could be prevailed upon to permit it to be continued?—So much prudence and discretion as you have; and you, in writing to me, lying under no temptation of following so bad an example as I have set—my letters too occasionally filled with self-accusation.\n",
      "They are too considerate, some of them at least, to permit that I should be put to such low difficulties.\n",
      "But I hope soon to put an end even to those small sort of obligations.\n",
      "Ought I to widen my error by obstinacy and resentment, because of their resentment; which must appear reasonable to them, as they suppose my flight premeditated; and as they are made to believe, that I am capable of triumphing in it, and over them, with the man they hate?\n",
      "When I have done all in my power to restore myself to their favour, I shall have the less to reproach myself with.\n",
      "And am I so reduced, as that, to save the poor remains of my reputation in the world's eye, I must watch the gracious motion from this man's lips?\n",
      "Nor is he so polite as his education, and other advantages, might have made one expect him to be.\n",
      "He is so little likely to make to himself an additional merit with the daughter upon it, that I shall be very sorry, if he risk any thing with the mother by it.\n",

      "She was not intimidated, however, and was going to rise upon me in her temper; and would have broken in upon my defence.\n",
      "But one day thou mayest wish, that thou hadst spared this boast; as well as those other pretty haughtinesses, 'That thou didst not reject Solmes for my sake: that my glory, if I valued myself upon carrying thee off, was thy shame: that I have more merit with myself than with thee, or any body else: [what a coxcomb she makes me, Jack!]\n",
      "If I should not be heard, what a sad thing would that be, for the most admirable of women!—Yet, as I do no often trouble Heaven with my prayers, who knows but this may be granted?\n",
      "What a horrible thing, that my talents point all that way!—When I know what is honourable and just; and would almost wish to be honest?—Almost, I say; for such a varlet am I, that I cannot altogether wish it, for the soul of me!—Such a triumph over the whole sex, if I can subdue this lady!\n",
      "while I always considered opposition and resistance as a challenge to do my worst.\n",
      "In my power, or out of my power, all one to this lady.—So, Belford, my poor vows are crammed down my throat, before they can well rise to my lips.\n",
      "One little piece of artifice I had recourse to: When she pushed so hard for me to leave her, I made a request to her, upon a condition she could not refuse; and pretended as much gratitude upon her granting it, as if it were a favour of the last consequence.\n",
      "but to promise what she had before promised, 'Never to marry any other man, while I am living, and single, unless I should give her cause for high disgust against me.'\n",
      "She consented; and asked what security I expected?\n",
      "She gave me her word: but I besought her excuse for sealing it: and in the same moment (since to have waited for consent would have been asking for a denial) saluted her.\n",
      "And now, Belford, I am only afraid that I shall be too cunning; for she does not at present talk enough for me.\n",
      "I hardly know what to make of the dear creature yet.\n",
      "Bitterly do they regret, that they permitted her poultry-visits, and garden-walks, which gave her the opportunity to effect an escape which they suppose preconcerted.\n",
      "I once had it in my head (and I hinted it to thee* in a former) in case such a step should be necessary, to attempt to carry her off by surprise from the wood-house; as it is remote from the dwelling-house.\n",
      "For well I knew, that James and Arabella were determined never to leave off their foolish trials and provocations, till, by tiring her out, they had either made her Solmes's wife, or guilty of some such rashness as should throw her for ever out of the favour of both her uncles; though they had too much malice in their heads to intend service to me by their persecutions of her.\n",
      "She must believe all my views to be honourable, when I had provided for her no particular lodgings, leaving it to her choice, whether she would go to M. Hall, to The Lawn, to London, or to either of the dowagers of my family.\n",
      "But for Mrs. Greme, poor woman!\n",
      "And were I now to lose her, how unworthy should I be to be the prince and leader of such a confraternity as ours!—How unable to look up among men!\n",
      "Whatever are the contents, I know not; but she was drowned in tears on the perusal of it.\n",
      "Her mother can hardly keep her in.\n",
      "Mrs. Howe is impatient of contradiction.\n",
      "I was forced to put it into the sweet novice's head, as well for my sake as for hers (lest we should be traceable by her direction) whither to direct the sending of her clothes, if they incline to do her that small piece of justice.\n",
      "If they do I shall begin to dread a reconciliation; and must be forced to muse for a contrivance or two to prevent it, and to avoid mischief.\n",
      "Thou wilt think me a sad fellow, I doubt.\n",
      "But are not all rakes sad fellows?—And art not thou, to thy little power, as bad as any?\n",
      "If thou dost all that's in thy head and in thy heart to do, thou art worse than I; for I do not, I assure you.\n",
      "A man would have no more to answer for than needs must.\n",
      "Then for the sex's curiosity, it is but remembering, in order to guard against it, that the name of their common mother was Eve.\n",
      "It is a respectable addition, although every sorry fellow assumes it, almost to the banishment of the usual traveling one of Captain.\n",
      "Yet I told her, that thou wert an awkward fellow; and this to do credit to thee, that she may not, if ever she be to see thee, expect a cleverer man than she'll find.\n",
      "O that my Clarissa were but half so acknowledging!\n",
      "With what high satisfaction and heart's-ease can I now sit down, and triumph over my men in straw at Harlowe-place!\n",
      "But had I even gone in with her unaccompanied, I think I had but little reason for apprehension: for well thou knowest, that the tame spirits which value themselves upon reputation, and are held within the skirts of the law by political considerations only, may be compared to an infectious spider; which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that can crush him, leaving all his toils defenceless, and to be brushed down at the will of the potent invader.\n",
      "While a silly fly, that has neither courage nor strength to resist, no sooner gives notice, by its buz and its struggles, of its being entangled, but out steps the self-circumscribed tyrant, winds round and round the poor insect, till he covers it with his bowel-spun toils; and when so fully secured, that it can neither move leg nor wing, suspends it, as if for a spectacle to be exulted over: then stalking to the door of his cell, turns about, glotes over it at a distance; and, sometimes advancing, sometimes retiring, preys at leisure upon its vitals.\n",
      "Nevertheless, to recur; I cannot but observe, that these tame spirits stand a poor chance in a fairly offensive war with such of us mad fellows as are above all law, and scorn to sculk behind the hypocritical screen of reputation.\n",
      "Add to this, in the question between me and the Harlowes, that the whole family of them must know that they have injured me—must therefore be afraid of me.\n",
      "I am afraid thou canst not help me to many remembrances of this sort; because I never was so bad as since I have known thee.\n",
      "Yet were it so, and life to be the forfeiture of being found at the female churches, I believe that I, like a second Clodius, should change my dress, to come at my Portia or Pompeia, though one the daughter of a Cato, the other the wife of a Caesar.\n",
      "The impatient wretch sent up to me several times, while I was writing my last to you, to desire my company: yet his business nothing particular; only to hear him talk.\n",
      "When I had finished the letter, and given it to Mr. Hickman's friend, I was going up again, and had got up half a dozen stairs; when he besought be to stop, and hear what he had to say.\n",
      "We began instantly our angry conference.\n",
      "He knew not, neither, he said, that he had so badly behaved himself, as to deserve so very severe a rebuke.\n",
      "Really, my dear, the man deserves not politer treatment.—And then has he not made a fool, an egregious fool of me?—I am afraid he himself thinks he has.\n",
      "I told him, that I desired his absence, of all things.\n",
      "This, Sir, will be so, said I, when you are not here to break in upon me, and make the apartments inconvenient.\n",
      "He wished, he said, he were at liberty, without giving me offence, or being thought to intend to infringe the articles I had stipulated and insisted upon, to make one humble proposal to me.\n",
      "But the sacred regard he was determined to pay to all my injunctions (reluctantly as I had on Monday last put it into his power to serve me) would not permit him to make it, unless I would promise to excuse him, if I did not approve of it.\n"

      "I had once before played about the skirts of the irrevocable obligation; but thought myself obliged to speak in clouds, and to run away from the subject, as soon as she took my meaning, lest she should imagine it to be ungenerously urged, now she was in some sort in my power, as she had forbid me beforehand, to touch upon it, till I were in a state of visible reformation, and till a reconciliation with her friends were probable.\n",
      "But now, out-argued, out-talented, and pushed so vehemently to leave one of whom I had no good pretence to hold, if she would go; and who could so easily, if I had given her cause to doubt, have thrown herself into other protection, or have returned to Harlowe-place and Solmes; I spoke out upon the subject, and offered reasons, although with infinite doubt and hesitation, [lest she should be offended at me, Belford!]\n",

      "But I hope, as I am out of all other protection, that he is not capable of mean or low resentments.\n",
      "He may; and lay it, if he pleases, to his character; which, as I have told him, gave at least a pretence to my brother against him.\n",
      "It cannot, cannot be, that I should have cause to apprehend him to be so ungenerous, so bad a man.\n",
      "And further let me observe, with respect to what you say, that there cannot be the same reason for a prohibition of correspondence with me, as there was of mine with Mr. Lovelace; that I thought as little of bad consequences from my correspondence with him at the time, as you can do from yours with me now.\n",
      "For, besides that it piqued me excessively from the nature of the artifice, I expected shuffling and evasion, if he were guilty, that would have incensed me: and, if not confessedly guilty, such unsatisfactory declarations as still would have kept my mind doubtful and uneasy; and would, upon every new offence that he might give me, sharpen my disgust to me.\n",
      "I will, without reserve, my dearest life, said he, tell you the whole; and hope that my sincerity in the relation will atone for any thing you may think wrong in the fact.\n",
      "'I knew nothing, said he, of this man, this Leman, and should have scorned a resort to so low a method as bribing the servant of any family to let me into the secrets of that family, if I had not detected him in attempting to corrupt a servant of mine, to inform him of all my motions, of all my supposed intrigues, and, in short, of every action of my private life, as well as of my circumstances and engagements; and this for motives too obvious to be dwelt upon.\n",

      "Had I taken your letter I must have been determined by the contents of it, for the present at least: but not having received it, and you having reason to think I wanted not resolution in a situation so desperate, to make your friends a personal visit, I depended upon the interview you had bid me hope for.'\n",

      "And yet I ever made shift to avoid anticipation: I never would eat the calf in the cow's belly, as Lord M.'s phrase is: for what is that, but to hold our lands upon tenant-courtesy, the vilest of all tenures?\n",

      "A strutting rascal of a cock have I beheld chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck-ing his mistress to him, when he has found a single barley-corn, taking it up with his bill, and letting it drop five or six times, still repeating his chucking invitation: and when two or three of his feathered ladies strive who shall be the first for it [O Jack!\n",
      "he directs the bill of the foremost to it; and when she has got the dirty pearl, he struts over her with an erected crest, cling round her with dropt wings, sweeping the dust in humble courtship: while the obliged she, half-shy, half-willing, by her cowering tail, prepared wings, yet seemingly affrighted eyes, and contracted neck, lets one see that she knows the barley-corn was not all he called her for.\n",
      "Believing she would certainly propose to have that favourite wench about her, as soon as she was a little settled, I had caused the girl to be inquired after, with an intent to make interest, some how or other, that a month's warning should be insisted on by her master or mistress, or by some other means, which I had not determined upon, to prevent her coming to her.\n",
      "The wench is luckily ill; a violent rheumatic disorder, which has obliged her to leave her place, confines her to her chamber.\n",

      "Is not this fair play?\n",
      "But there was a little touch of policy in it besides; that the lady, if I should fly out again, should not think me too gross an hypocrite: for, as I plainly told her, I was afraid, that my fits of reformation were but fits and sallies; but I hoped her example would fix them into habits.\n",
      "Thus he\n",

      "This lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner (and then her voice is all harmony when she touches a subject she is pleased with) that I could have listened to her for half a day together.\n",
      "But, after all, Belford, I would fain know why people call such free-livers as you and me hypocrites.—That's a word I hate; and should take it very ill to be called by it.\n",
      "He owns, therefore, what it would be to no purpose to conceal; and his ingenuousness is a salvo—'Why, this, Madam, is no more than Mr. Lovelace himself acknowledges.'\n",
      "Yet I have wished fifty times, since Lovelace got you away, that you were rid of him, whether it were by a burning fever, by hanging, by drowning, or by a broken neck; provided it were before he laid you under a necessity to go into mourning for him.\n",
      "I told him I would oblige him, because minds in trouble take kindly any body's civilities: but that he was not to imagine that he particularly obliged me by this; since I should think the man or woman either blind or stupid who admired not a person of your exalted merit for your own sake, and wished not to serve you without view to other reward than the honour of serving you.\n",
      "I detain your messenger while I write an answer to yours; the poor old man not being very well.\n",
      "But I may not, from one very sad reflection, think better of him; that I am thrown too much into his power, to make it necessary for him (except he were to intend the very utmost villany by me) to be such a shocking hypocrite?\n",
      "You yourself must join with me in this hope, or you could not wish me to be so dreadfully yoked.\n",

      "I am quite petulant, fretful, and peevish, with myself, at times, to find that I am bound to see the workings of the subtle, or this giddy spirit, which shall I call it?\n",
      "What an useful lesson would this afford, were it properly inculcated at the time that the tempted mind was balancing upon a doubtful adventure?\n",
      "Letter X.\n",
      "Gentleness of heart, surely, is not despicable in a man.\n",
      "He took notice of the serious humour he found me in, and of the redness of my eyes.\n",
      "I am afraid, my dear, that his relations are among those who think I have taken a rash and inexcusable step.\n",
      "O my dear, how uneasy to us are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence, when we know we have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing!\n",
      "that I am half afraid of him.\n",
      "I suppose, Sir, that if my father propose my return, and engage never to mention Solmes to me, nor any other man, but by my consent, and I agree, upon that condition, to think no more of you, you will acquiesce.\n",
      "He must needs say, there was no love lost between some of my family and him; but he had not deserved of them what they had of him.\n",
      "And all I know, Sir, is, that if I do give my father the power of a negative, and he will be contented with that, it will be but my duty to give it him; and if I preserve one to myself, I shall break through no obligation to you.\n",
      "Your duty to your capricious brother, not to your father, you mean, Madam.\n",
      "He may, Madam—but that exempts him not from blame for all that, if he take the wrong—\n",

      "I am sorry for the poor creature's illness as for my own disappointment by it.\n",
      "If I have nothing for it, as you say, but matrimony, it yields little comfort, that his relations do not despise the fugitive, as persons of their rank and quality-pride might be supposed to do, for having been a fugitive.\n",

      "\n",
      "I am extremely rejoiced to hear, that we shall so soon have you in town after so long an absence.\n",
      "I have been in town for this week past, to get help if I could, from my paralytic complaints; and am in a course for them.\n",
      "The owner of those in Norfolk-street would have half the house go together.\n",
      "But she is very careful, she says, that she takes no lodgers, but of figure and reputation.\n",
      "They have but lately quitted them, on his being presented to a considerable church preferment in Ireland.\n",
      "If these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned, be not altogether to your lady's mind, she may continue in them the less while, and choose others for herself.\n",
      "The terms, she says, she will not fall out upon, when she knows what your lady expects, and what her servants are to do, or yours will undertake; for she observed that servants are generally worse to deal with than their masters or mistresses.\n",
      "She said, she could; and wished, by all means, it were to be so: since the circumstance of a person's being single, it not as well recommended as this lady, was one of the usual exceptions.\n",
      "Nor should I have disliked a lodging in the heart of it, having heard but indifferent accounts of the liberties sometimes taken at the other end of the town.—Then seeming to incline to the lodgings in Cecil-street—Then to the mercer's.\n",
      "As for a maid servant, poor Hannah's illness is a great disappointment to me: but, as he observes, I can make the widow satisfaction for one of hers, till I can get a servant to my mind.\n",
      "And you know I want not much attendance.\n",
      "Who could forbear smiling, to see my charmer, like a farcical dean and chapter, choose what was before chosen for her; and sagaciously (as they go in form to prayers, that Heaven would direct their choice) pondering upon the different proposals, as if she would make me believe she had a mind for some other?\n",
      "None at all, 'tis plain.\n",
      "Silly little rogues!\n",
      "But, Belford, didst thou not mind that sly rogue Doleman's naming Dover-street for the widow's place of abode?—What dost thou think could be meant by that?—'Tis impossible thou shouldst guess, so, not to puzzle thee about it, suppose the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street should be inquired after by some officious person, in order to come at characters [Miss Howe is as sly as the devil, and as busy to the full,] and neither such a name, nor such a house, can be found in that street, nor a house to answer the description; then will not the keenest hunter in England be at a fault?\n",
      "Have I not reason to snuff the moon with my proboscis?—Lord help thee for a poor, for a very poor creature!—Wonder not that I despise thee heartily; since the man who is disposed immoderately to exalt himself, cannot do it but by despising every body else in proportion.\n",
      "Thou wouldst wonder if thou knewest one half of my providences.\n",
      "Your brother having been assured that you are not married, has taken a resolution to find you out, waylay you, and carry you off.\n",
      "But we cannot bear that such an admirable creature should be made the tennis-ball of two violent spirits—much less that you should be seized, and exposed to the brutal treatment of wretches who have no bowels.\n",
      "He is now and then my almoner, and, I believe, always adds to my little benefactions.\n",
      "But he is really a silly fellow, my dear, to trouble his head about me, when he sees how much I despise his whole sex; and must of course make a common man look like a fool, were he not to make himself look like one, by wishing to pitch his tent so oddly.\n",
      "You are afraid that my mother will question me on this subject; and then you think I must own the truth.\n",
      "But little as I love equivocation, and little as you would allow of it in your Anna Howe, it is hard if I cannot (were I to be put to it ever so closely) find something to say that would bring me off, as you have, what can you do at such a place as London?—You don't know what occasion you may have for messengers, intelligence, and suchlike.\n",
      "Some daughters would be tempted to think that controul sat very heavy upon a mother, who can endeavour to exert the power she has over a child, and regret, for years after death, that she had not the same over a husband.\n",
      "The misfortune was, in short, that when one was out of humour, the other would be so too: yet neither of their tempers comparatively bad.\n",
      "But, setting my mother out of the question, because she is my mother, have I not seen how Lady Hartley pranks up herself above all her sex, because she knows how to manage affairs that do not belong to her sex to manage?—Affairs that do no credit to her as a woman to understand; practically, I mean; for the theory of them may not be amiss to be known.\n",
      "If you will be informed of the particulars of our contention, after you have known in general that your unhappy affair was the subject, why then, I think I must tell you.\n",
      "I know this will trouble you: so spare yourself the pains to tell me it does.\n",
      "Poor man!\n",
      "He stands a whimsical chance between us.\n",
      "But this way of putting it is middling the matter between what I have learnt of my mother's over-prudent and your enlarged notions.—But from doctrine to fact—\n",
      "\n",
      "I shut myself up all that day; and what little I did eat, eat alone.\n",
      "My bold resistance, she told me, had provoked her to slap my hand; and she was sorry to have been so provoked.\n",
      "It was unsuitable both to my inclination and to my honour, at the instigation of base minds to give up a friend in distress.\n",
      "There were other duties, I said, besides the filial one; and I hoped I need not give up a suffering friend, especially at the instigation of those by whom she suffered.\n",
      "So you see, my dear, that I fare the worse on Mr. Hickman's account!\n",
      "You know, you say, that your account of the contentions between your mother and you will trouble me; and so you bid me spare myself the pains to tell you that they do.\n",
      "What though I have so miserably fallen, and am unhappy, if ever I had any judgment worth regarding, it is now as much worth as ever, because I can give it as freely against myself as against any body else.\n",
      "And shall I not, when there seems to be an infection in my fault, and that it leads you likewise to resolve to carry on a correspondence against prohibition, expostulate with you upon it; when whatever consequences flow from your disobedience, they but widen my error, which is as the evil root, from which such sad branches spring?\n",
      "A prejudice in favour is as hard to be totally overcome as a prejudice in disfavour.\n",
      "There are other duties, you say, besides the filial duty: but that, my dear, must be a duty prior to all other duties; a duty anterior, as I may say, to your very birth: and what duty ought not to give way to that, when they come in competition?\n",
      "One evil draws on another after it; and how knows she, or any body, where it may stop?\n",
      "For in that period do we not generally attract the eyes of the other sex, and become the subject of their addresses, and not seldom of their attempts?\n",
      "Is it so hard for you, my dear, to be treated like a child?\n",
      "And can you not think it is hard for a good parent to imagine herself under the unhappy necessity of so treating her woman-grown daughter?\n",
      "Will you give me leave to add to this tedious expostulation, that I by no means approve of some of the things you write, in relation to the manner in which your father and mother lived—at times lived—only at times, I dare say, though perhaps too often.\n",
      "Your mother is answerable to any body, rather than to her child, for whatever was wrong in her conduct, if any thing was wrong, towards Mr. Howe: a gentleman, of whose memory I will only say, that it ought to be revered by you—But yet, should you not examine yourself, whether your displeasure at your mother had no part in your revived reverence for your father at the time you wrote?\n",
      "But this subject must not be pursued.\n",
      "That your generosity should fail in an instance where policy, prudence, gratitude, would not permit it to fail?\n",
      "But indeed you once, I remember, advanced, that, as different attainments required different talents to master them, so, in the writing way, a person might not be a bad critic upon the works of others, although he might himself be unable to write with excellence.\n",
      "In other words, to employ itself rather in the out-door search, than in the in-door examination.\n",
      "As to the money, you so generously and repeatedly offer, don't be angry with me, if I again say, that I am very desirous that you should be able to aver, without the least qualifying or reserve, that nothing of that sort has passed between us.\n",
      "And now, my dear, a few words, as to the prohibition laid upon you; a subject that I have frequently touched upon, but cursorily, because I was afraid to trust myself with it, knowing that my judgment, if I did, would condemn my practice.\n",
      "If there were any prospect of a reconciliation with my friends, I should not have so much regard for my pride, as to be afraid of any body's knowing how much I have been outwitted as you call it.\n",
      "If I scrupled this, my brother would rather triumph over me, than keep my secret.\n",
      "If my past conduct in that case shall not be found to deserve heavy blame, I shall then perhaps have the benefit of her advice, as well as yours.\n",
      "As to cramping my spirit, as you call it, (were I to sit down to write what I know your mother must see,) that, my dear, is already cramped.\n",
      "And do not think so unhandsomely of your mother, as to fear that she would make partial constructions against me.\n",
      "Do not however think me guilty of an affectation in what I have said of my brother and sister.\n",
      "And now, one word, as to the freedom I have treated you with in this tedious expostulatory address.\n",
      "And all this upon the following consideration; 'that it is much more eligible, as well as honourable, to be corrected with the gentleness that may be expected from an undoubted friend, than, by continuing either blind or wilful, to expose ourselves to the censures of an envious and perhaps malignant world.'\n",
      "But it is as needless, I dare say, to remind you of this, as it is to repeat my request, so often repeated, that you will not, in your turn, spare the follies and the faults of\n",

      "Your Honner got her away, it seems, by a false letter to her, macking believe as how her she-cuzzen, that she derely loved, was coming to see her; and was tacken ill upon the rode: and so Miss Batirton set out in a shase, and one sarvant, to fet her cuzzen from the inne where she laid sick, as she thote: and the sarvant was tricked, and braute back the shase; but Miss Batirton was not harde of for a month, or so.\n",
      "And when it came to passe, that her frends founde her out and would have prossekutid your Honner, your Honner was gone abroad: and so she was broute to bed, as one may say, before your Honner's return: and she got colde in her lyin-inn, and lanquitched, and soon died: and the child is living; but your Honner never troubles your Honner's hedd about it in the least.\n",
      "And this, and some other matters, of verry bad reporte, 'Squier Solmes was to tell my young lady of, if so be she would have harde him speke, before we lost her sweet company, as I may say, from heere.\n",
      "Your Honner helped me to many ugly stories to tell against you Honner to my younge master, and younge mistriss; but did not tell me about this.\n",
      "I hope it was not so verry bad as Titus says it was; for he ses as how there was a rape in the case betwixt you at furste, and plese your Honner; and my cuzzen Titus is a very honist younge man as ever brocke bred.\n",
      "If there should be danger of your Honner's life, I hope your Honner will not be hanged like as one of us common men; only have your hedd cut off, or so: and yet it is pit such a hedd should be lossed: but if as how it should be prossekutid to that furr, which God forbid, be plesed natheless to thinck of youre fethful Joseph Leman, before your hedd be condemned; for after condemnation, as I have been told, all will be the king's or the shreeve's.\n",
      "I have gin him a hint already: for what, as I sed to him, cuzzen Titus, signifies stirring up the coles and macking of strife, to make rich gentilfolkes live at varience, and to be cutting of throtes, and such-like?\n",
      "And this, and plese your Honner, gis me hopes of him, if so be your Honner gis me direction; sen', as God kno'es, I have a poor, a verry poor invenshon; only a willing mind to prevent mischief, that is the chief of my aim, and always was, I bless my God!—Els I could have made much mischief in my time; as indeed any sarvant may.\n",
      "Your Honner nathaless praises my invenshon every now-and-then: Alas!\n",
      "Two days, as I may say, off and on, have I been writing this long letter.\n",
      "Prayey, your Honner, forgive the gesting of a poor plane man.\n",
      "We common fokes have our joys, and plese your Honner, lick as our betters have; and if we be sometimes snubbed, we can find our underlings to snub them agen; and if not, we can get a wife mayhap, and snub her: so are masters some how or other oursells.\n",
      "And here is the sad thing; they cannot come to clere up matters with my deerest young lady, because, as your Honner has ordered it, they have these stories as if bribed by me out of your Honner's sarvant; which must not be known for fere you should kill'n and me too, and blacken the briber!—Ah!\n",
      "But if my deerest younge lady should come to harm, and plese your Honner, the horsepond at the Blew Bore—but Lord preserve us all from all bad mischeff, and all bad endes, I pray the Lord!—For tho'ff you Honner is kinde to me in worldly pelf, yet what shall a man get to loos his soul, as holy Skrittuer says, and plese your Honner?\n",
      "But natheless I am in hope of reppentence hereafter, being but a younge man, if I do wrong thro' ignorens: your Honner being a grate man, and a grave wit; and I a poor crature, not worthy notice; and your Honner able to answer for all.\n",
      "It is cruel to ask a modest woman for her consent.\n",
      "She loved me too well to have appeared against me; she refused to sign a paper they had drawn up for her, to found a prosecution upon; and the brutal creatures would not permit the mid-wife's assistance, till her life was in danger; and, I believe, to this her death was owing.\n",
      "I think of nobody else—it is impossible I should.\n",
      "I have contrived to see the boy twice, unknown to the aunt who takes care of him; loves him; and would not now part with him on any consideration.\n",
      "He that makes life itself not so is a sad fellow, and has the worst of it.\n",
      "I loved her too—for she was taken from me by her cruel friends, while our joys were young.\n",
      "As to the journey of little Titus, (I now recollect the fellow by his name) let that take its course: a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago; no process begun in her life-time; refusing herself to give evidence against me while she lived—pretty circumstances to found an indictment for a rape upon!\n",
      "But this has not been either your fault or mine: it is owing to the black, pitch-like blood of your venomous-hearted young master, boiling over, as he owns, that our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated.\n",
      "She has it in her head, I doubt not, to make me submit to the people I hate; and if I did, they would rather insult me, than receive my condescension as they ought.\n",
      "At the place where we are, we cannot long be private.\n",
      "The lodgings are inconvenient for us, while both together, and while she refuses to marry.\n",
      "Little need for your fears for my angel!\n",
      "I only am in danger: but were I the free-liver I am reported to be, all this could I get over with a wet finger, as the saying is.\n",
      "You may tell them, that if this can be effected, it will make me raving mad; and bring your young lady into all their measures.\n",
      "You can inform them, as from my servant, of the distance she keeps me at, in hopes of procuring her father's forgiveness, by cruelly giving me up, if insisted upon.\n",
      "You can tell them, that as the only secret my servant has kept from you is the place we are in, you make no doubt, that a two-guinea bribe will bring that out, and also an information when I shall be at a distance from her, that the enterprise may be conducted with safety.\n",
      "If they listen to your proposal, you will promote your interest with Betty, by telling it to her as a secret.\n",
      "You can give James Harlowe and Singleton continual false scents, as I shall direct you; so that no mischief can possibly happen.\n",
      "The whole Harlowe family, whom you have so faithfully served, ['tis serving them, surely, to prevent the mischief which their violent son would have brought upon them,] will throw you in somewhat towards housekeeping.\n",
      "* And I humbly beseech you to favour the contents of it with your interest.\n",
      "Hitherto it is in my power to perform what I undertake for in this letter; and it would be very grievous to me to be precipitated upon measures, which may render the desirable reconciliation more difficult.\n",
      "If, Madam, I were permitted to write to you with the hopes of being answered, I could clear my intention with regard to the step I have taken, although I could not perhaps acquit myself to some of my severest judges, of an imprudence previous to it.\n",
      "I flatter myself, that their favour is yet retrievable: but, whatever be the determination at Harlowe-place, do not you, my dearest Aunt, deny me the favour of a few lines to inform me if there can be any hope of a reconciliation upon terms less shocking than those heretofore endeavoured to be imposed upon me; or if (which God forbid!)\n",
      "At least, my dear Aunt, procure for me the justice of my wearing apparel, and the little money and other things which I wrote to my sister for, and mention in the enclosed to you; that I may not be destitute of common conveniencies, or be under a necessity to owe an obligation for such, where, at present, however, I would least of all owe it.\n",
      "Allow me to say, that had I designed what happened, I might (as to the money and jewels at least) have saved myself some of the mortification which I have suffered, and which I still further apprehend, if my request be not complied with.\n",
      "And yet it is entirely from my own reflections that I am so, having nothing to find fault with in the behaviour of the person from whom every evil was to be apprehended.\n",
      "What politeness can be expected from such a man?\n",
      "Why, you must despise him: you must hate him, if you can, and run away from him—But whither?—Whither indeed, now that your brother is laying foolish plots to put you in a still worse condition, as it may happen.\n",
      "But if you cannot despise and hate him—if you care not to break with him, you must part with some punctilio's.\n",
      "Give over then, my dearest friend, any thoughts of this hopeless reconciliation, which has kept you balancing thus long.\n",
      "But I am afraid that you was too scrupulous: for did he not resent that reference?\n",
      "* The reader who has seen his account, which Miss Howe could not have\n",
      "seen, when she wrote thus, will observe that it was not possible for a\n",
      "person of her true delicacy of mind to act otherwise than she did, to a\n",
      "man so cruelly and so insolently artful.\n",
      "But were it to me, a girl of spirit as I am thought to be, I do assure you, I would, in a quarter of an hour (all the time I would allow to punctilio in such a case as yours) know what he drives at: since either he must mean well or ill; if ill, the sooner you know it, the better.\n",

      "And of this I assured his Lordship; who was half afraid of thee, because of the ill usage thou receivedst from her family.\n",
      "But now, that the case is altered, let me press the matter home to thee from other considerations.\n",
      "And let me tell thee, Lovelace, that in this lady's situation, the trial is not a fair trial.\n",
      "May there not be other Lovelaces, thou askest, who, attracted by her beauty, may endeavour to prevail with her?\n",
      "If thou imaginest there could, such is thy pride, that thou wouldst think the worse of thyself.\n",
      "That she loves thee, wicked as thou art, and cruel as a panther, there is no reason to doubt.\n",
      "Though persecuted on the one hand, as she was, by her own family, and attracted, on the other, by the splendour of thine; every one of whom courts her to rank herself among them!\n",
      "If thou art not so narrow-minded an elf, as to prefer thine own single satisfaction to posterity, thou, who shouldst wish to beget children for duration, wilt not postpone till the rake's usual time; that is to say, till diseases or years, or both, lay hold of thee; since in that case thou wouldst entitle thyself to the curses of thy legitimate progeny for giving them a being altogether miserable: a being which they will be obliged to hold upon a worse tenure than that tenant-courtesy, which thou callest the worst;* to wit, upon the Doctor's courtesy; thy descendants also propagating (if they shall live, and be able to propagate) a wretched race, that shall entail the curse, or the reason for it, upon remote generations.\n",
      "That is to say, in plain English, [nor think thou me too grave, Lovelace: thou art grave sometimes, though not often,] we hope to live to sense, as long as sense can relish, and purpose to reform when we can sin no longer.\n",
      "Strange informations are every day received about you.\n",
      "As soon as I was intrusted myself with their intention to give up the point, I gave you a hint—a dark one perhaps*—but who would have thought—O Miss!—Such an artful flight!—Such cunning preparations!\n",
      "would have humbled themselves to you: and if you could have denied them, and refused to sign the settlements previous to the meeting, they would have yielded, although with regret.\n",
      "Thus complied with, and perhaps blessed, by your father and mother, and the consequences of your disobedience deprecated in the solemnest manner by your inimitable mother, your generosity would have been appealed to, since your duty would have been fount too weak an inducement, and you would have been bid to withdraw for one half hour's consideration.\n",
      "We rather expected, we rather feared, a still more desperate adventure.\n",
      "There could be but one more desperate; and I was readier to have the cascade resorted to, than the garden back-door.—Your mother fainted away, while her heart was torn between the two apprehensions.—Your father, poor man!\n",
      "your father was beside himself for near an hour—What imprecations!—What dreadful imprecations!—To this day he can hardly bear your name: yet can think of nobody else.\n",
      "I am sorry for it; but am afraid nothing you ask will be complied with.\n",
      "What a poor pride is it to stand upon any thing else!\n",
      "how unhappy have you made every body!\n",
      "Your poor mother—but why should I afflict you?\n",
      "Yet not married, it seems!\n",
      "It would be very grievous, you say, to be precipitated upon measures that may make the desirable reconciliation more difficult.\n",
      "Is it now, my dear, a time for you to be afraid of being precipitated?\n",
      "I know your purity—But, my dear, are you not out of all protection?—Are you not unmarried?—Have you not (making your daily prayers useless) thrown yourself into temptation?\n",
      "You have hitherto, you say, (and I think, my dear, with an air unbecoming to your declared penitence,) no fault to find with the behaviour of a man from whom every evil was apprehended: like Caesar to the Roman augur, which I heard you tell of, who had bid him beware the Ides of March: the Ides of March, said Caesar, seeing the augur among the crowd, as he marched in state to the senate-house, from which he was never to return alive, the Ides of March are come.\n",
      "And I dare say you will not show what I have written to Mr. Lovelace—for I have written with the less reserve, depending upon your prudence.\n",
      "Dolly would have several times written: but having defended your fault with heat, and with a partiality that alarmed us, (such a fall as your's, my dear, must be alarming to all parents,) she has been forbidden, on pain of losing our favour for ever: and this at your family's request, as well as by her father's commands.\n",
      "You have the poor girl's hourly prayers, I will, however, tell you, though she knows not what I do, as well as those of\n",
      "\n",
      "Your truly afflicted aunt, D. HERVEY.\n",
      "Be pleased, my dear, to keep her secret of having written to the unhappy wretch her niece.\n",
      "One comfort only arises to me from its being sent; that my aunt will clear herself, by the communication, from the supposition of having corresponded with the poor creature whom they have all determine to reprobate.\n",
      "My poor cousin Dolly, you see, has reason to regret on this account, as well as my aunt.\n",
      "Yet the man who has drawn me into all this evil I must be thrown upon!—Much did I consider, much did I apprehend, before my fault, supposing I were to be guilty of it: but I saw it not in all its shocking lights.\n",
      "My aunt need not have been afraid, that it should be known that she has sent me such a letter as this!—A father to kneel to his child!—There would not indeed have been any bearing of that!—What I should have done in such a case, I know not.\n",
      "Yet, had but the sacrifice of inclination and personal preference been all, less than KNEELING should have been done.\n",
      "the finer sensibilities, if I may suppose mine to be such, make not happy.\n",
      "Such an upshot, as she calls it, of this unhappy affair, Heaven avert!\n",
      "She flies a thought, that I can less dwell upon—a cruel thought—but she has a poor opinion of the purity she compliments me with, if she thinks that I am not, by God's grace, above temptation from this sex.\n",
      "Although I never saw a man, whose person I could like, before this man; yet his faulty character allowed me but little merit from the indifference I pretended to on his account.\n",
      "But, now I see him in nearer lights, I like him less than ever.\n",
      "Unpolite, cruel, insolent!—Unwise!\n",
      "Upon my word, I think I could hate him, (if I do not already hate him) sooner than any man I ever thought tolerably of—a good reason why: because I have been more disappointed in my expectations of him; although they never were so high, as to have made him my choice in preference to the single life, had that been permitted me.\n",
      "You will say I rave: forbidden to write to my aunt, and taught to despair of reconciliation, you, my dear, must be troubled with my passionate resentments.\n",
      "And that he had designed ultimately to relent, how it clears my friends (at least to themselves) and condemns me!\n",
      "Since it is now too late to look back, let me collect all my fortitude, and endeavour to stand those shafts of angry Providence, which it will not permit me to shun!\n",
      "Now indeed is my heart broken!\n",
      "There is no bearing the thoughts of it: for [shocking reflection!]\n",
      "It was expected you would send again to me, or to my aunt Hervey.\n",
      "This is a favour you'll see by the within letter not designed you: and now not granted for your sake, but because my poor mother cannot bear in her sight any thing you used to wear.\n",
      "My father, in the first agitations of his mind, on discovering your wicked, your shameful elopement, imprecated on his knees a fearful curse upon you.\n",
      "But does the wretch put you upon writing for your things, for fear you should be too expensive to him?—That's it, I suppose.\n",
      "Your drawings and your pieces are all taken down; as is also your whole-length picture, in the Vandyke taste, from your late parlour: they are taken down, and thrown into your closet, which will be nailed up, as if it were not a part of the house, there to perish together: For who can bear to see them?\n",
      "of your boasted figure; and this by those fond parents from whom you have run away with so much, yet with so little contrivance!\n",
      "My brother vows revenge upon your libertine—for the family's sake he vows it—not for yours!—for he will treat you, he declares, like a common creature, if ever he sees you: and doubts not that this will be your fate.\n",
      "So do I, base, unworthy creature!\n",
      "Nor yet the jewels so undeservedly made yours.\n",
      "If all this is heavy, lay your hand to your heart, and ask yourself, why you have deserved it?\n",
      "Can you think that Heaven will seal to the black passions of its depraved creatures?\n",
      "If it did, malice, envy, and revenge would triumph; and the best of the human race, blasted by the malignity of the worst, would be miserable in both worlds.\n",
      "'Tis all owing to rage and disappointment—disappointment in designs proper to be frustrated.\n",
      "If you consider this malediction as it ought to be considered, a person of your piety must and will rather pity and pray for your rash father, than terrify yourself on the occasion.\n",
      "None bug God can curse; parents or others, whoever they be, can only pray to Him to curse: and such prayers can have no weight with a just and all-perfect Being, the motives to which are unreasonable, and the end proposed by them cruel.\n",
      "Pray for your father, then, I repeat, that he incur not the malediction he has announced on you; since he has broken, as you see, a command truly divine; while you, by obeying that other precept which enjoins us to pray for them that persecute and curse us, will turn the curse into a blessing.\n",
      "Lord bless me, how your aunt writes!—Can there be two rights and two wrongs in palpable cases!—But, my dear, she must be wrong: so they all have been, justify themselves now as they will.\n",
      "They can only justify themselves to themselves from selfish principles, resolving to acquit, not fairly to try themselves.\n",
      "Did your unkind aunt, in all the tedious progress of your contentions with them, give you the least hope of their relenting?—Her dark hints now I recollect as well as you.\n",
      "I will keep your aunt's secret, never fear.\n",
      "In justice to the man I shall have, I have vowed this: for, my dear, must I not be miserable, if you are so?\n",
      "He cannot prove base to such an excellence.\n",
      "So it will be best, when you are in London, to be private, and, for fear of the worst, to let every direction to be a third place; for I would not, for the world, have you fall into the hands of such flaming and malevolent spirits by surprize.\n",
      "Besides, this measure will make you less apprehensive of the consequences of their violence, should they resolve to attempt to carry you of in spite of Lovelace.\n",
      "They have prevailed upon her, I know, to give her word to this purpose—Spiteful, poor wretches!\n",
      "How I hate in particular your foolish uncle Antony.\n",
      "I would not have your thought dwell on the contents of your sister's shocking letter; but pursue other subjects—the subjects before you.\n",
      "So far you may enter into this hateful subject.\n",
      "Come, my dear, when things are at worst they will mend.\n",
      "Good often comes when evil is expected.—But if you despond, there can be no hopes of cure.\n",
      "Don't let them break your heart; for that is plain to me, is now what some people have in view for you to do.\n",
      "How poor to withhold from you your books, your jewels, and your money!\n",
      "As money is all you can at present want, since they will vouchsafe to send your clothes, I send fifty guineas by the bearer, enclosed in single papers in my Norris's Miscellanies.\n",
      "I received my sister's dreadful letter on Sunday, when Mr. Lovelace was out.\n",
      "He saw, on his return, my extreme anguish and dejection; and he was told how much worse I had been: for I had fainted away more than once.\n",
      "I was so ill that he himself advised me to delay going to town on Monday, as I proposed to do.\n",
      "He is extremely regardful and tender of me.\n",
      "All that you supposed would follow the violent letter, from him, has followed it.\n",
      "He presses me every hour (indeed as needlessly, as unkindly) for fresh tokens of my esteem for him, and confidence in him.\n",
      "Abandoned thus of all my natural friends, of whose returning favour I have now no hopes, and only you to pity me, and you restrained, as I may say, I have been forced to turn my desolate heart to such protection as I could find.\n",
      "I hope no mischief will happen on the road.—I hope these violent spirits will not meet.\n",
      "But this dreadful letter has unhinged my whole frame.\n",
      "Then some little punctilio surely is necessary.\n",
      "Grief so extreme: no pleasure in prospect, nor so much as in wish—O my dear, who could think of entering into so solemn an engagement?\n",
      "Excuse this depth of vapourish dejection, which forbids me even hope, the cordial that keeps life from stagnating, and which never was denied me till within these eight-and-forty hours.\n",
      "I am sorry you sent back my Norris.\n",
      "* Mr. Lovelace, in his next Letter, tells his friend how extremely ill\n",
      "the Lady was, recovering from fits to fall into stronger fits, and\n",
      "nobody expecting her life.\n",
      "But it is a strange perverseness in human nature that we slight that when near us which at a distance we wish for.\n",
      "Yet Mr. Hickman, though he pleases not my eye, nor diverts my ear, will not, as I believe, disgust the one, nor shock the other.\n",
      "Your man, as I have lately said, will always keep up attention; you will always be alive with him, though perhaps more from fears than hopes: while Mr. Hickman will neither say any thing to keep one awake, nor yet, by shocking adventures, make one's slumbers uneasy.\n",
      "Yet the meekness of the man might have soon convinced her, I should have thought; for my father, it seems, would talk as loud as she, I suppose, (though within a few yards of each other,) as if both were out of their way, and were hallooing at half a mile's distance, to get in again.\n",
      "You must not chide me too severely, however, because I have learned of you not to defend myself in an error: and I own I am wrong: and that's enough: you won't be so generous in this case as you are in every other, if you don't think it is.\n",
      "It may be proper to insert here the\n",
      "   following extracts from that answer, though a little before the time.]\n",
      "You assume, my dear, says she, your usual and ever-agreeable style in what you write of the two gentlemen,* and how unaptly you think they have chosen; Mr. Hickman in addressing you, Mr. Lovelace me.\n",
      "But I am inclinable to believe that, with a view to happiness, however two mild tempers might agree, two high ones would make sad work of it, both at one time violent and unyielding.\n"

      "Absent when it came—on my return I found her recovering from fits, again to fall into stronger fits; and nobody expecting her life; half a dozen messengers dispatched to find me out.\n",
      "Nor wonder at her being so affected; she, whose filial piety gave her dreadful faith in a father's curses; and the curse of this gloomy tyrant extending (to use her own words, when she could speak) to both worlds—O that it had turned, in the moment of its utterance, to a mortal quinsy, and, sticking in his gullet, had choked the old execrator, as a warning to all such unnatural fathers!\n",
      "But extreme dejection, with a mingled delicacy, that in her dying moments I doubt not she will preserve, have caused her to refuse me the time, though not the solemnity; for she has told me, that now she must be wholly in my protection [being destitute of every other!]\n",

      "But nothing I am sure will happen: for, by a letter received just now from Joseph, I understand, that James Harlowe has already laid aside his stupid project: and this by the earnest desire of all those of his friends to whom he had communicated it; who were afraid of the consequences that might attend it.\n",
      "She hopes also her jewels, and some gold, which she left behind her: but Joseph says, clothes only will be sent.\n",

      "The widow, in the conversation we had after breakfast, gave us an account of the military merit of the Colonel her husband, and, upon this occasion, put her handkerchief to her eyes twice or thrice.\n",
      "It must, no doubt, be a most affecting thing to be separated from a good husband, and to be left in difficult circumstances besides, and that not by his fault, and exposed to the insults of the base and ungrateful, as she represented her case to be at his death.\n",
      "The widow directed all her talk to me, as to Mrs. Lovelace; and I, with a very ill grace bore it.\n",
      "Yet was I not conscious of guilt.\n",

      "Poor man!\n",
      "little did I expect to hear he went to any place of devotion.\n",
      "I asked, if the presence of the visible king of, comparatively, but a small territory, did not take off, too generally, the requisite attention to the service of the invisible King and Maker of a thousand worlds?\n",
      "I said, I should be a very unhappy creature if I could not bear my own company.\n",
      "Hardened by frequent public appearances, they would be as much ashamed to be found guilty of these weaknesses, as men.\n",

      "As a very particular relation of this evening's conversation would be painful to me, you must content yourself with what you shall be able to collect from the outlines, as I may call them, of the characters of the persons; assisted by the little histories Mr. Lovelace gave me of each yesterday.\n",
      "He is said to be a man of sense.— Mr. Belton dresses gaily, but not quite foppishly; drinks hard; keeps all hours, and glories in doing so; games, and has been hurt by that pernicious diversion: he is about thirty years of age: his face is a fiery red, somewhat bloated and pimply; and his irregularities threaten a brief duration to the sensual dream he is in: for he has a short consumption cough, which seems to denote bad lungs; yet makes himself and his friends merry by his stupid and inconsiderate jests upon very threatening symptoms which ought to make him more serious.\n",
      "Indeed he doubts nothing but what he ought to believe; for he jests upon sacred things; and professes to hate the clergy of all religions.\n",
      "He has high notions of honour, a world hardly ever out of his mouth; but seems to have no great regard to morals.\n",
      "He is the youngest of the five, except Mr. Lovelace, and they are perhaps the wickedest; for they seem to lead the other three as they please.\n",
      "But Mr. Belford had visibly the advantage of the other, having quicker parts, and by taking the worst side of the argument, seemed to think he had.\n",
      "Mr. Belford, to my no small vexation and confusion, with the forwardness of a favoured and intrusted friend, singled me out, on Mr. Lovelace's being sent for down, to make me congratulatory compliments on my supposed nuptials; which he did with a caution, not to insist too long on the rigorous vow I had imposed upon a man so universally admired—\n",
      "\n",
      "'See him among twenty men,' said he, 'all of distinction, and nobody is regarded but Mr.\n",
      "It must, indeed, be confessed, that there is, in his whole deportment, a natural dignity, which renders all insolent or imperative demeanour as unnecessary as inexcusable.\n",
      "Then that deceiving sweetness which appears in his smiles, in his accent, in his whole aspect, and address, when he thinks it worth his while to oblige, or endeavour to attract, how does this show that he was born innocent, as I may say; that he was not naturally the cruel, the boisterous, the impetuous creature, which the wicked company he may have fallen into have made him!\n",
      "Mr. Belford looked at me when he spoke: yes, my dear, he smilingly looked at me; and he looked upon his complimented friend; and all their assenting, and therefore affronting eyes, both men's and women's, were turned upon your Clarissa; at least, my self-reproaching heart made me think so; for that would hardly permit my eye to look up.\n",
      "to reflect one moment on the exaltation she gives him, and the disgrace she brings upon herself,—the low pity, the silent contempt, the insolent sneers and whispers, to which she makes herself obnoxious from a censuring world of both sexes,—how would she despise herself!\n",
      "There might be nothing in it; and my denial carried a stiff and ill- natured appearance.\n",
      "I told her that I was writing a long letter: that I should choose to write till I were sleepy, and that a companion would be a restraint upon me, and I upon her.\n",
      "She should be very sorry, if she had asked an improper thing.\n",
      "The poor thing, she said, was afraid to lie alone.\n",
      "And then Mrs. Sinclair hesitating, and moving towards the door, (though she turned round to me again,) I desired her, (lighting her,) to take care how she went down.\n",
      "Pray, Madam, said she, on the stairs-head, don't give yourself all this trouble.\n",
      "I don't love to do an uncivil thing.\n",
      "And if nothing were meant by the request, my refusal deserves to be called uncivil.\n",
      "His companions are shocking creatures.\n",
      "With infinite regret I am obliged to tell you, that I can no longer write to you, or receive letters from you.—Your mother has sent me a letter enclosed in a cover to Mr. Lovelace, directed for him at Lord M.'s, (and which was brought him just now,) reproaching me on this subject in very angry terms, and forbidding me, 'as I would not be thought to intend to make her and you unhappy, to write to you without her leave.'\n",
      "So, my dear, I choose, you see, rather to rely upon your discretion, than to feign reasons with which you would not be satisfied, but with your usual active penetration, sift to the bottom, and at last find me to be a mean and low qualifier; and that with an implication injurious to you, that I supposed you had not prudence enough to be trusted with the naked truth.\n",
      "If I find that I can be of use to you, either by advice or information, do you think I will not give it!—Were it to any other person, much less dear to me than you are, do you think, in such a case, I would forbear giving it?\n",
      "A few words upon the subject of your last letters.\n",
      "A dead silence reigns in your family.\n",
      "What could he mean, as you say, by his earnestness to bring you into such company, and to give you such an opportunity to make him and them reflecting-glasses to one another?\n",
      "Pity you had not admitted her!\n",
      "Bad as he is, nobody accounts him a sordid man.\n",
      "And I wonder he has been hitherto silent on that subject.\n",
      "I forego every other engagement, I suspend ever wish, I banish every other fear, to take up my pen, to beg of you that you will not think of being guilty of such an act of love as I can never thank you for; but must for ever regret.\n",
      "There are some points so flagrantly wrong that they will not bear to be argued upon.\n",
      "Heaven forbid that it should be known that you had it but once in your thought, be your motives ever so noble and generous, to follow so bad an example, the rather, as that you would, in such a case, want the extenuations that might be pleaded in my favour; and particularly that one of being surprised into the unhappy step!\n",
      "The restraint your mother lays you under would not have appeared heavy to you but on my account.\n",
      "Those passions in our sex, which we take pains to subdue, may have one and the same source with those infinitely-blacker passions, which we used so often to condemn in the violent and headstrong of the other sex; and which may only be heightened in them by custom, and their freer education.\n",
      "discomposure gives distress to a weak heart, whether it arise from friendship or enmity.\n",
      "MADAM,\n",
      "\n",
      "I have the honour of dear Miss Howe's commands to acquaint you, without knowing the occasion, 'That she is excessively concerned for the concern she has given you in her last letter: and that, if you will but write to her, under cover as before, she will have no thoughts of what you are so very apprehensive about.\n",
      "'—Yet she bid me write, 'That if she had but the least imagination that she can serve you, and save you,' those are her words, 'all the censures of the world will be but of second consideration with her.'\n",
      "And at parting last night, or rather this morning, thou madest me promise a few lines to Edgware, to let thee know what she thinks of thee, and of thy brethren.\n",
      "I am sorry for it too, as to thy part; for two reasons—one, that I think thy motive for thy curiosity was fear of consciousness: whereas that of the arch-thief was vanity, intolerable vanity: and he was therefore justly sent away with a blush upon his cheeks to heaven, and could not brag—the other, that I am afraid, if she dislikes thee, she dislikes me: for are we not birds of a feather?\n",
      "I don't know how it is, Belford; but women think themselves entitled to take any freedoms with us; while we are unpolite, forsooth, and I can't tell what, if we don't tell a pack of cursed lies, and make black white, in their favour—teaching us to be hypocrites, yet stigmatizing us, at other times, for deceivers.\n",
      "I will summarily give thee a few of my pleas.\n",
      "Had she honoured us with more of her conversation, she would have been less disgusted with ours; for she saw how every one was prepared to admire her, whenever she opened her lips.\n",
      "You, in particular, had said, when she retired, that virtue itself spoke when she spoke, but that you had such an awe upon you, after she had favoured us with an observation or two on a subject started, that you should ever be afraid in her company to be found most exceptionable, when you intended to be least so.'\n",
      "She, artfully, made lighter of her denial of the girl for a bedfellow, than she thought of it, I could see that; for it was plain, she supposed there was room for me to think she had been either over-nice, or over- cautious.\n",
      "No; there was no great matter in it.\n"

      "Come, come, my dearest friend, consider but these things; and steadily, without desponding, pursue your earnest purposes to amend what you think has been amiss; and it may not be a misfortune in the end that you have erred; especially as so little of your will was in your error.\n",
      "Your elders have I seen declining to offer their opinions upon a subject till you had delivered yours; often, to save themselves the mortification of retracting theirs, when they heard yours.\n",

      "This, Madam, has been an unhappy week; for had I not stood upon such bad terms with you, you might have been new mistress of that house; and probably had my cousin Montague, if not Lady Betty, actually with you.\n",

      "I was afraid that she indeed despises me.—And I cannot bear to think that she does.\n",
      "But, Belford, I do not intend that this lady shall be bound down to so cruel a fate.\n",

      "You have pretended to find free fault with my father's temper, Mr. Lovelace: but the worst that he ever showed after marriage, was not in the least to be compared to what you have shown twenty times beforehand.—And what are my prospects with you, at the very best?—My indignation rises against you, Mr. Lovelace, while I speak to you, when I recollect the many instances, equally ungenerous and unpolite, of your behaviour to one whom you have brought into distress—and I can hardly bear you in my sight.\n",
      "She turned from me, standing up; and, lifting up her folded hands, and charming eyes swimming in tears, O my father, said the inimitable creature, you might have spared your heavy curse, had you known how I have been punished ever since my swerving feet led me out of your garden-doors to meet this man!—Then, sinking into her chair, a burst of passionate tears forced their way down her glowing cheeks.\n",
      "My dearest life, [taking her still folded hands in mine,] who can bear an invocation so affecting, though so passionate?\n",

      "What have I done to deserve this impatient exclamation?—Have I, at any time, by word, by deeds, by looks, given you cause to doubt my honour, my reverence, my adoration, I may call it, of your virtues?\n",

      "O Mr. Lovelace, we have been long enough together to be tired of each other's humours and ways; ways and humours so different, that perhaps you ought to dislike me, as much as I do you.—I think, I think, that I cannot make an answerable return to the value you profess for me.\n",
      "You have given me an ill opinion of all mankind; of yourself in particular: and withal so bad a one of myself, that I shall never be able to look up, having utterly and for ever lost all that self-complacency, and conscious pride, which are so necessary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable satisfaction to herself.\n",
      "You know, that you are not under any to me.—My broken fortunes I matter not—\n",
      "\n",
      "She was proceeding—My dearest life, said I, I have been all this time, though you fill me with doubts of your favour, busy in the nuptial preparations.\n",
      "I put the paper in my pocket, and turned to my charmer, less disconcerted, as she, by that time, had also a little recovered herself.\n",
      "Do you think it must not be matter of high regret to me, to find my wishes so often delayed and postponed in favour of your predominant view to a reconciliation with relations who will not be reconciled to you?—To this was owing your declining to celebrate our nuptials before we came to town, though you were so atrociously treated by your sister, and your whole family; and though so ardently pressed to celebrate by me—to this was owing the ready offence you took at my four friends; and at the unavailing attempt I made to see a dropt letter; little imagining, from what two such ladies could write to each other, that there could be room for mortal displeasure—to this was owing the week's distance you held me at, till you knew the issue of another application.—But, when they had rejected that; when you had sent my cold-received proposals to Miss Howe for her approbation or advice, as indeed I advised; and had honoured me with your company at the play on Saturday night; (my whole behaviour unobjectionable to the last hour;) must not, Madam, the sudden change in your conduct the very next morning, astonish and distress me?—and this persisted in with still stronger declarations, after you had received the impatiently-expected letter from Miss Howe; must I not conclude, that all was owing to her influence; and that some other application or project was meditating, that made it necessary to keep me again at a distance till the result were known, and which was to deprive me of you for ever?\n",
      "Curse upon the heart of the little devil, said I, who instigates you to think so hardly of the faithfullest heart in the world!\n",
      "And now I know how to account for a temper that I hope is not natural to you.\n",
      "Miss Howe likes some of your ways as little as I do; for I have set every thing before her.\n",
      "I blamed myself, at the same time, for the invitation I had given to Lord M., as it might subject me to delay from his infirmities: but told her, that I would write to him to excuse me, if she had no objection; or to give him the day she would give me, and not wait for him, if he could not come in time.\n",
      "Be not surprised.\n",
      "But indeed, Mr. Lovelace, [and wept through impatience,] you either know not how to treat with a mind of the least degree of delicacy, notwithstanding your birth and education, or you are an ungrateful man; and [after a pause] a worse than ungrateful one.\n",
      "I think I hate you.\n",
      "How it would mortify my vanity, if I thought there was a woman in the world, much more this, that could hate me!\n",
      "Were I to read it attentively, not a wink should I sleep this night.\n",
      "To-morrow it shall obtain my serious consideration.\n",
      "She is not very well, as Dorcas tells me.\n",
      "It is impossible that I should proceed with my projects against this admirable woman, were it not that I am resolved, after a few trials more, if as nobly sustained as those she has passed through, to make her (if she really hate me not) legally mine.\n",
      "Your circumstances, Sir, will not oblige you to extort violently from him what is in his hands.\n",
      "All that depends upon me, either with regard to my person, to my diversions, or to the economy that no married woman, of whatever rank or quality, should be above inspecting, shall be done, to prevent a necessity for such measures being taken.\n",
      "But, Sir, your's was the foundation-fault: at least, you gave a too-plausible pretence for my brother's antipathy to work upon.\n",
      "'But this may lead into hateful recrimination.—Let it be remembered, I will only say, in this place, that, in their eye, you have robbed them of a daughter they doated upon; and that their resentments on this occasion rise but in proportion to their love and their disappointment.\n",
      "'Let me only, on this subject, further observe, that condescension is not meanness.\n",
      "There is a glory in yielding, that hardly any violent spirit can judge of.\n",
      "My brother, perhaps, is no more sensible of this than you.\n",
      "But as you have talents, which he has not, (who, however, has, as I hope, that regard for morals, the want of which makes one of his objections to you,) I could wish it may not be owing to you, that your mutual dislikes to each other do not subside!\n",
      "All I wish for, is the power of relieving the lame, the blind, the sick, and the industrious poor, and those whom accident has made so, or sudden distress reduced.\n",
      "The common or bred beggars I leave to others, and to the public provision.\n",
      "Although these are not sent me, I have no doubt, being merely personals, but they will, when I should send for them in another name: till when I should not choose to wear any.\n",
      "Now I think of it, a man should be in the wrong now-and-then, to make his wife shine.\n",
      "But for a wife to come up with kemboed arm, the other hand thrown out, perhaps with a pointing finger—Look ye here, Sir!—Take notice!—If you are wrong, I'll be wrong!—If you are in a passion, I'll be in a passion!\n"

      "Then these little sly rogues, how they lie couchant, ready to spring upon us harmless fellows the moment we are in their reach!—When the ice is once broken for them, how swiftly can they make to port!—Mean time, the subject they can least speak to, they most think of.\n",
      "Little saucy-faced designers!\n",
      "And who knows, but that, by degrees, those new friends, by their rank and merit, may have weight enough to get me restored to the favour of my relations?\n",
      "No matter for that: she believes she acts upon her own judgment: and deserves to be punished for pretending to judgment, when she has none.— Every living soul, but myself, I can tell thee, shall be punished, that treats either cruelly or disrespectfully so adored a lady.—What a plague!\n",
      "I have already broken the matter to our three confederates; as a supposed, not a resolved-on case indeed.\n",
      "And yet they know, that with me, in a piece of mischief, execution, with its swiftest feel, is seldom three paces behind projection, which hardly ever limps neither.\n",
      "BELTON, indeed, hesitates a little, because matters go wrong between him and his Thomasine; and the poor fellow has not the courage to have his sore place probed to the bottom.\n",

      "'Tis plaguy hard, if we cannot find, or make a storm.\n",
      "—A rich thought—is it not, Belford?—He is certainly plaguy officious in the ladies' correspondence; and I am informed, plays double between mother and daughter, in fear of both.—Dost not see him, Jack?—I do— popping up and down, his wig and hat floating by him; and paddling, pawing, and dashing, like a frighted mongrel—I am afraid he never ventured to learn to swim.\n",
      "But thou wilt not drown the poor fellow; wilt thou?\n",
      "No, no!—that is not necessary to the project—I hate to do mischiefs supererogatory.\n",
      "The skiff shall be ready to save him, while the vessel keeps its course: he shall be set on shore with the loss of wig and hat only, and of half his little wits, at the place where he embarked, or any where else.\n",
      "Would not a brave fellow choose to appear in court to such an arraignment, confronting women who would do credit to his attempt?\n",
      "Let me indulge in a few reflections upon what thou mayest think the worst that can happen.\n",
      "Next comes the poor maid—who, perhaps, has been ravished twenty times before; and had not appeared now, but for company-sake; mincing, simpering, weeping, by turns; not knowing whether she should be sorry or glad.\n",
      "and every single man wish he had been me!\n",
      "* Within these few years past, a passage has been made from the prison to the sessions-house, whereby malefactors are carried into court without going through the street.\n",
      "Well, but suppose, after all, we are convicted; what have we to do, but in time make over our estates, that the sheriffs may not revel in our spoils?—There is no fear of being hanged for such a crime as this, while we have money or friends.—And suppose even the worst, that two or three were to die, have we not a chance, each man of us, to escape?\n",
      "So thou seest the worst that can happen, should we not make the grand tour upon this occasion, but stay and take our trials.\n",
      "If not, no risque on our side will be run; only taking our pleasure abroad, at the worst; leaving friends tired of us, in order, after a time, to return to the same friends endeared to us, as we to them, by absence.\n",
      "But I will refer this subject to its proper season.\n",
      "Thou knowest, that I never absolutely conclude upon a project, till 'tis time for execution; and then lightning strikes not quicker than I.\n",
      "And now to the subject next my heart.\n",
      "But as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble, I think I ought not, in gratitude, to spare combustibles for her; but, on the contrary, to make her stare and stand aghast, by springing three or four mines at once.\n",
      "All that vexes me, in the midst of my gloried-in devices, is, that there is a sorry fellow in the world, who has presumed to question, whether the prize, when obtained, is worthy of the pains it costs me: yet knows, with what patience and trouble a bird-man will spread an acre of ground with gins and snares; set up his stalking horse, his glasses; plant his decoy- birds, and invite the feathered throng by his whistle; and all his prize at last (the reward of early hours, and of a whole morning's pains) only a simple linnet.\n",
      "To be serious, Belford, I must acknowledge, that all our pursuits, from childhood to manhood, are only trifles of different sort and sizes, proportioned to our years and views: but then is not a fine woman the noblest trifle, that ever was or could be obtained by man?—And to what purpose do we say obtained, if it be not in the way we wish for?—If a man is rather to be her prize, than she his?\n",
      "That thou art a cursed fellow, if—\n",
      "\n",
      "If—no if's—but I shall be very sick to-morrow.\n",
      "Sick!—Why sick?\n",
      "What a-devil shouldst thou be sick for?\n",
      "I am excessively disturbed about this smuggling scheme of Miss Howe.\n",
      "I once believed she loved me: but now I doubt whether she does or not: at least, that it is with such an ardour, as Miss Howe calls it, as will make her overlook a premeditated fault, should I be guilty of one.\n",
      "And what will being sick do for thee?\n",
      "I don't intend to be so very bad as Dorcas shall represent me to be.\n",
      "Now, Belford, I shall expect, that she will show some concern at the broken vessel, as it may be attended with fatal effects, especially to one so fiery in his temper as I have the reputation to be thought to be: and the rather, as I shall calmly attribute the accident to the harasses and doubts under which I have laboured for some time past.\n",
      "Why then I shall have the less remorse, if I am to use a little violence: for can she deserve compassion, who shows none?\n",
      "Well but, Lovelace, how the deuce wilt thou, with that full health and vigour of constitution, and with that bloom in thy face, make any body believe thou art sick?\n",
      "How!—Why, take a few grains of ipecacuanha; enough to make me reach like a fury.\n",
      "But then I will be persuaded by Mrs. Sinclair, that I have of late confined myself too much; and so will have a chair called, and be carried to the Park; where I will try to walk half the length of the Mall, or so; and in my return, amuse myself at White's or the Cocoa.\n",
      "And then, truly, they are for helping me out with some of their trite and vulgar artifices.\n",
      "Because this little devil made her first sacrifice at my altar, she thinks she may take any liberty with me: and what makes her outrageous at times is, that I have, for a long time, studiously, as she says, slighted her too-readily-offered favours: But is it not very impudent in her to think, that I will be any man's successor?\n",
      "This, thou knowest, was always my rule—Once any other man's, and I know it, and never more mine.\n",
      "But I say, not; since, hence, I have but very few adulteries to answer for.\n",

      "Tell him the lady is ill; and has lain down upon the couch.\n",
      "Offer him money—take this half-guinea for him—complain of your head, to have a pretence to hold it down; and cover your forehead and eyes with your hand, where your handkerchief hides not your face.—That's right—and dismiss the rascal—[here he comes]—as soon as you can.\n",

      "But I was bidden to observe how you looked, and how you was; and if you did write a line or two, to take care of it, and give it only to our young landlady in secret.\n",
      "You see I look strangely.\n",
      "A cup of small ale, I don't care if I do.\n",
      "Margaret, take the young man down, and treat him with what the house affords.\n",
      "A piece of powdered beef was upon the table, at the sign of the Castle, where I stopt to inquire for this house: and so, thoff I only intended to wet my whistle, I could not help eating.\n",
      "At the same time, the dog wrapped himself round Margery, and gave her a smack, that, she told Mrs. Bevis afterwards, she might have heard into the parlour.\n",
      "This ready, though raw wench, gave an instance of this, and improved on the dropsical hint I had given her.\n",
      "The lady's seeming plumpness was owing to a dropsical disorder, and to the round posture she lay in—very likely, truly.\n",
      "No: she was so ill she could not write; which was a great grief to her.\n",
      "Well, then, if she had nothing to send by him, mayhap he might stay in town a day or two; for he had never seen the lions in the Tower, nor Bedlam, nor the tombs; and he would make a holiday or two, as he had leave to do, if she had no business or message that required his posting down next day.\n",
      "And so the shocking rascal went away: and glad at my heart was I when he was gone; for I feared nothing so much as that he would have staid till they came from church.\n",
      "By the enclosed thou wilt see, that neither of the correspondents deserve mercy from me: and I am resolved to make the ending with one the beginning with the other.\n",
      "If thou sayest that the provocations I have given to one of them will justify her freedoms; I answer, so they will, to any other person but myself.\n",
      "If thou sayest, it is, however, wrong to do so; I reply, that it is nevertheless human nature:—And wouldst thou not have me to be a man, Jack?\n",
      "And it is as strange to me, that, having got you at such a shocking advantage, and in such a horrid house, you could, at the time, escape dishonour, and afterwards get from such a set of infernals.\n",
      "I gave you, in my long letter of Wednesday and Thursday last, reasons why you ought to mistrust that specious Tomlinson.\n",
      "One, in particular, of so shocking a nature!—Indeed, my dear, the man's a devil.\n",
      "Give your consent, my dear; and the horrid villain shall be repaid with broken bones, at least, for all his vileness!\n",
      "He must have been sportive and wanton in his inventions—yet that cruel, that savage sportiveness has saved you from the sudden violence to which he has had recourse in the violation of others, of names and families not contemptible.\n",
      "Had I not given him the reason, he might have thought still worse of the vile attempt.\n",
      "You hate him, heartily hate him, I hope, my dear—I am sure you do.\n",
      "And if he has, it is a wonder that he did not likewise get my long one of the 7th.\n",
      "I shall long to hear how you and Mrs. Townsend order matters.\n",
      "Allow me to make a few observations upon some of its contents.\n",
      "It is strange to Miss Howe, that having got her friend at such a shocking advantage, &c. And it is strange to me, too.\n",
      "Very hard, Belford, that credits cannot be set against debits, and a balance struck in a rake's favour, as well as in that of every common man!—But he, from whom no good is expected, is not allowed the merit of the good he does.\n",
      "For, notwithstanding that the measures of right and wrong are said to be so manifest, let me tell thee, that character biases and runs away with all mankind.\n",
      "to be so careless of mine!—And now, I doubt, it is irretrievable.—But to leave moralizing.\n",
      "—Or can she have heard of my intrigue with the pretty gipsey, who met me in Norwood, and of the trap I caught her cruel husband in, [a fellow as gloomy and tyrannical as old Harlowe,] when he pursued a wife, who would not have deserved ill of him, if he had deserved well of her!—But he was not quite drowned.\n",
      "The man is alive at this day, and Miss Howe mentions the story as a very shocking one.\n",
      "But evil fame and scandal are always new.\n",
      "But well said the honest corregidor at Madrid, [a saying with which I encroached Lord M.'s collection,]—Good actions are remembered but for a day: bad ones for many years after the life of the guilty.\n",
      "In other words, such is the desire which every one has to exculpate himself by blackening his neighbour.\n",
      "Apes, mere apes of us!\n",
      "But I repeat, that the word is a mere word, the thing a mere name with them; a cork-bottomed shuttle-cock, which they are fond of striking to and fro, to make one another glow in the frosty weather of a single-state; but which, when a man comes in between the pretended inseparables, is given up, like their music and other maidenly amusements; which, nevertheless, may be necessary to keep the pretty rogues out of active mischief.\n",
      "But, when he arrived at the pontificate, he took it down, saying, that there was no need of the net, when he had caught the fish.\n",
      "Well, but next comes an indictment against poor beauty!\n",
      "And I wished her absence, though any other woman were present, that I might try the differences in Miss Howe's behaviour before her friend's face, or behind her back.\n",
      "Delicate women make delicate women, as well as decent men.\n",
      "says, That she was always more afraid of Clarissa than of her mother; and, in Vol.\n",
      "As to Mrs. Townsend,—her manlike spirit—her two brothers—and the ships' crews—I say nothing but this to the insolent threatening—Let 'em come!—But as to her sordid menace—To repay the horrid villain, as she calls me, for all my vileness by BROKEN BONES!—Broken bones, Belford!— Who can bear this porterly threatening!—Broken bones, Jack!—D—n the little vulgar!—Give me a name for her—but I banish all furious resentment.\n",
      "—I am—and have not the least doubt but I shall have secured my goods before Thursday, or Wednesday either.\n",
      "Like Alexander, who wept, that he had no more worlds to conquer, she will be looking out for new exercises for her power, till she grow uneasy to herself, a discredit to her husband, and a plague to all about her.\n",
      "Dost think, that I should not first have rescued the lady, and then, if needful, have asked excuse for it, the lady in my hand?—Wouldst not thou have done thus, as well as I?\n",
      "Villany is a word that she is extremely fond of.\n",
      "But I can tell her, that it is impossible I should, till the end of this villany be obtained.\n",
      "Miss Rawlins was sent for home almost as soon as she came in, to entertain an unexpected visiter; to her great regret, as well as to the disappointment of my fair-one, as I could perceive from the looks of both: for they had agreed, it seems, if I went to town, as I said I intended to do, to take a walk upon the Heath, at least in Mrs. Moore's garden; and who knows, what might have been the issue, had the spirit of curiosity in the one met with the spirit of communication in the other?\n",
      "Miss Rawlins promised to return, if possible: but sent to excuse herself: her visiter intending to stay with her all night.\n",
      "She had vouchsafed, I should have told thee, with eyes turned from me, and in a half-aside attitude, to sip two dishes of tea in my company— Dear soul!—How anger unpolishes the most polite!\n",
      "for I never saw Miss Harlowe behave so awkwardly.\n",
      "I imagined she knew not how to be awkward.\n",
      "The Captain, I told her, was rid down post, in a manner, to forward my wishes with her uncle.—Lady Betty and Miss Montague were undoubtedly arrived in town by this time.\n",
      "But yet, as she may find reasons to change her mind in my absence, I shall not entirely trust to this.\n",
      "And if, in the last attempt, I find her not one, what will she be the worse for the trial?—No one is to blame for suffering an evil he cannot shun or avoid.\n",
      "what a difficulty must a man be allowed to have to conquer a predominant passion, be it what it will, when the gratifying of it is in his power, however wrong he knows it to be to resolve to gratify it!\n",
      "And is a woman who can live thus prettily without controul; who ever did prefer, and who still prefers, the single to the married life; and who will be enabled to do every thing that the plan she had formed will direct her to do; to be said to be ruined, undone, and such sort of stuff?—I have no patience with the pretty fools, who use those strong words, to describe a transitory evil; an evil which a mere church-form makes none?\n",
      "This, as I grow older, may increase; and when my active capacity begins to abate, I may sit down with the preacher, and resolve all my past life into vanity and vexation of spirit.\n",
      "I have often thought it very unhappy for us both, that so excellent a creature sprang up a little too late for my setting out, and a little too early in my progress, before I can think of returning.\n"

      "For, after all, what is there in her case that should stupify such a glowing, such a blooming charmer?—Excess of grief, excess of terror, have made a person's hair stand on end, and even (as we have read) changed the colour of it.\n",
      "But I will leave this subject, least it should make me too grave.\n",
      "What's the matte with me, I wonder!—I must breathe a fresher air for a few days.\n",
      "I have just now had a specimen of what the resentment of this dear creature will be when quite recovered: an affecting one!—For entering her apartment after Dorcas; and endeavouring to soothe and pacify her disordered mind; in the midst of my blandishments, she held up to Heaven, in a speechless agony, the innocent license (which she has in her own power); as the poor distressed Catalans held up their English treaty, on an occasion that keeps the worst of my actions in countenance.\n",
      "Thou wilt guess, by what I have written, that some little art has been made use of: but it was with a generous design (if thou'lt allow me the word on such an occasion) in order to lessen the too-quick sense she was likely to have of what she was to suffer.\n",
      "Hence my concern—for I think the poor lady ought not to have been so treated.\n",
      "Poor lady, did I say?—What have I to do with thy creeping style?—But have not I the worst of it; since her insensibility has made me but a thief to my own joys?\n",
      "I did not intend to tell thee of this little innocent trick; for such I designed it to be; but that I hate disingenuousness: to thee, especially: and as I cannot help writing in a more serious vein than usual, thou wouldst perhaps, had I not hinted the true cause, have imagined that I was sorry for the fact itself: and this would have given thee a good deal of trouble in scribbling dull persuasives to repair by matrimony; and me in reading thy cruel nonsense.\n",
      "Besides, one day or other, thou mightest, had I not confessed it, have heard of it in an aggravated manner; and I know thou hast such an high opinion of this lady's virtue, that thou wouldst be disappointed, if thou hadst reason to think that she was subdued by her own consent, or any the least yielding in her will.\n",
      "And now is the whole secret out.\n",
      "I am sorry to hear of thy misfortune; but hope thou wilt not long lie by it.\n",
      "Thy servant tells me what narrow escape thou hadst with thy neck, I wish it may not be ominous: but I think thou seemest not to be in so enterprising a way as formerly; and yet, merry or sad, thou seest a rake's neck is always in danger, if not from the hangman, from his own horse.\n",

      "The fellow tells me, thou desirest me to continue to write to thee in order to divert thy chagrin on thy forced confinement: but how can I think it in my power to divert, when my subject is not pleasing to myself?\n",
      "Yet I could almost join with thee in the wish, which thou sendest me up by thy servant, unfriendly as it is, that I had had thy misfortune before Monday night last: for here, the poor lady has run into a contrary extreme to that I told thee of in my last: for now is she as much too lively, as before she was too stupid; and 'bating that she has pretty frequent lucid intervals, would be deemed raving mad, and I should be obliged to confine her.\n",

      "I sat down to say a great deal—my heart was full—I did not know what to say first—and thought, and grief, and confusion, and (O my poor head) I cannot tell what—and thought, and grief and confusion, came crowding so thick upon me; one would be first; another would be first; all would be first; so I can write nothing at all.—Only that, whatever they have done to me, I cannot tell; but I am no longer what I was-in any one thing did I say?\n",
      "I can write no more of this eloquent nonsense myself; which rather shows a raised, than a quenched, imagination: but Dorcas shall transcribe the others in separate papers, as written by the whimsical charmer: and some time hence when all is over, and I can better bear to read them, I may ask thee for a sight of them.\n",

      "And I think I have the worst of it by much: since very little has been my joy—very much my trouble.\n",
      "Here, only recapitulating, (think, then, how I must be affected at the time,) I was forced to leave off, and sing a song to myself.\n",
      "And fell into the old dismal thirtieth of January strain; I hemmed up for a sprightlier note; but it would not do; and at last I ended, like a malefactor, in a dead psalm melody.\n",
      "Heigh-ho!—I gape like an unfledged kite in its nest, wanting to swallow a chicken, bobbed at its mouth by its marauding dam!—\n",
      "\n",
      "What a-devil ails me?—I can neither think nor write!\n",
      "Lie down, pen, for a moment!\n",
      "Was it necessary to humble me down to the low level of thy baseness, before I could be a wife meet for thee?\n",
      "But still she insisted upon being a free agent; of seeing herself in other lodgings before she would give what I urged the least consideration.\n",
      "She seemed even choked with grief and disappointment.\n",
      "I dreaded her returning malady: but, entreaty rather exasperating, I affected an angry air.—I bid her expect the worst she had to fear—and was menacing on, in hopes to intimidate her; when, dropping to my feet,\n",
      "\n",
      "'Twill be a mercy, said she, the highest act of mercy you can do, to kill me outright upon this spot—this happy spot, as I will, in my last moments, call it!—Then, baring, with a still more frantic violence, part of her enchanting neck—Here, here, said the soul-harrowing beauty, let thy pointed mercy enter!\n",
      "and I will thank thee, and forgive thee for all the dreadful past!—With my latest gasp will I forgive and thank thee!— Or help me to the means, and I will myself put out of the way so miserable a wretch!\n",
      "Am I not ready to make you all the reparation that I can make you?\n",
      "—Then quitting Dorcas, down she threw herself upon her knees, in the furthermost corner of the room, clasping a chair with her face laid upon the bottom of it!—O where can I be safe?—Where, where can I be safe, from this man of violence?—\n",
      "\n",
      "This gave Dorcas an opportunity to confirm herself in her lady's confidence: the wench threw herself at my feet, while I seemed in violent wrath; and embracing my knees, Kill me, Sir, kill me, Sir, if you please!\n",
      "This, humoured by me, Begone, devil!—Officious devil, begone!—startled the dear creature: who, snatching up hastily her head from the chair, and as hastily popping it down again in terror, hit her nose, I suppose, against the edge of the chair; and it gushed out with blood, running in a stream down her bosom; she herself was too much frighted to heed it!\n",
      "that all I apprehended was but a bloody nose, which, as far as I know (for it could not be stopped in a quarter of an hour) may have saved her head and her intellects.\n",
      "But I see by this scene, that the sweet creature is but a pretty coward at bottom; and that I can terrify her out of her virulence against me, whenever I put on sternness and anger.\n",
      "But with all this dear creature's resentment against me, I cannot, for my heart, think but she will get all over, and consent to enter the pale with me.\n",
      "What force [allow me a serious reflection, Jack: it will be put down!\n",
      "What force] have evil habits upon the human mind!\n",
      "The lady tells Dorcas, that her heart is broken: and that she shall live but a little while.\n",
      "And while I can think that all her trials are but additions to her honour, and that I have laid the foundations of her glory in my own shame, can I be called cruel, if I am not affected with her grief as some men would be?\n",
      "And for what should her heart be broken?\n",
      "And should she escape me, and no such effect follow, my revenge on her family, and, in such a case, on herself, would be incomplete, and I should reproach myself as long as I lived.\n",
      "And pr'ythee, Jack, see in this my ardent hope, a distinction in my favour from other rakes; who, almost to a man, follow their inclinations without troubling themselves about consequences.\n",
      "Thou must be partial in the highest degree, if now thou blamest me for resuming my former schemes, since in that case I shall but follow her cue.\n",
      "No forced construction of her actions do I make on this occasion, in order to justify a bad cause or a worse intention.\n",
      "A slight pretence, indeed, served the wolf when he had a mind to quarrel with the lamb; but this is not now my case.\n",
      "and furthermore to stoop to artifice, to be guilty of the reigning vice of the times, of bribery and corruption!\n",
      "He is a violent wretch!—But, Dorcas, [dear Dorcas, now it is,] thou shalt have a friend in me to the last day of my life.\n",
      "O, I have rings and other valuables.\n",
      "But now, alas!\n",
      "Well, Madam, your's is a hard lot.\n",
      "I pity you at my heart!\n",
      "Thank you, Dorcas!—I am unhappy, that I did not think before, that I might have confided in thy pity, and in thy sex!\n",
      "I pitied you, Madam, often and often: but you were always, as I thought, diffident of me.\n",
      "to be so sadly betrayed;——\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, Dorcas!\n",
      "I was basely drawn in!\n",
      "[and then with her apron she gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubs] I may curse the time that I came into this house!\n",
      "And was it not better for Dorcas to give up a house which her lady could not think worse of than she did, in order to gain the reputation of sincerity, than by offering to vindicate it, to make her proffered services suspected.\n",
      "Poor Dorcas!—Bless me!\n",
      "how little do we, who have lived all our time in the country, know of this wicked town!\n",
      "I am sorry, very sorry, you have had so hard a lot.\n",
      "But now, Jack, for a serious reflection upon the premises.\n",
      "For here, had Dorcas been good, and been tempted as she was tempted to any thing evil, I make no doubt but she would have yielded to the temptation.\n",
      "The vicious are as bad as they can be; and do the Devil's work without looking after; while he is continually spreading snares for the others; and, like a skilful angler, suiting his baits to the fish he angles for.\n",
      "Nor let even honest people, so called, blame poor Dorcas for her fidelity in a bad cause.\n",
      "Methought I was in a dreadful agony, when I found the lady had escaped, and in my wrath had like to have slain Dorcas, and our mother, and every one I met.\n",
      "For, methought, two young nieces of her's had broken in upon them, in the middle of the dismal tale.\n",
      "coming to bed again in the dark, the young lady, to her infinite astonishment, grief, and surprise, found mother H. turned into a young person of the other sex; and although Lovelace was the abhorred of her soul, yet, fearing it was some other person, it was matter of consolation to her, when she found it was no other than himself, and that she had been still the bed-fellow of but one and the same man.\n",
      "Now thou wilt say this was a very odd dream.\n",
      "But I forgot to tell thee one part of my dream; and that was, that, the next morning, the lady gave way to such transports of grief and resentment, that she was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt upon her own life.\n",
      "Three weeks ago I heard her say it was: and I have down the birthday of every one in the family, and the wedding-day of her father and mother.\n",
      "And indeed if she has any gratitude, and has in her the least of her sex's foibles, she must think I deserve her favour, by the pains she has cost me.\n",
      "she is very ill—in a violent fever, Dorcas thinks.\n",
      "For my own part, libertine as people think me, when I had occasion to be sick, I took a dose of ipecacuanha, that I might not be guilty of a falsehood; and most heartily sick was I; as she, who then pitied me, full well knew.\n",
      "how strangely will my dream be made out!\n",
      "Is it not wonderful?\n",
      "All the family used, he says, to meet to celebrate it with him; but as they are at present in too unhappy a situation for that, he will give out, that, not being able to bear the day at home, he has resolved to be absent for two or three days.\n",
      "I owned to you, when in town last, that I took slight notice to my dear friend of the misunderstanding between you and his niece; and that I did this, for fear the lady should have shown any little discontent in his presence, had I been able to prevail upon him to go up in person, as then was doubtful.\n",
      "My absence, when your messenger came, must excuse me for not writing by him.\n",
      "What shall I say now!—I, who but a few hours ago had such faith in dreams, and had proposed out of hand to begin my treatise of dreams sleeping and dreams waking, and was pleasing myself with the dialogues between the old matronal lady and the young lady, and with the metamorphoses, (absolutely assured that every thing would happen as my dream chalked it out,) shall never more depend upon those flying follies, those illusions of a fancy depraved, and run mad.\n",
      "But first I sent to know how she did; and receiving for answer, Very ill: had a very bad night: which latter was but too probable; since this I know, that people who have plots in their heads as seldom have as deserve good ones.\n",
      "But the uncertainty she was in from\n",
      "   that time, with the execrable treatment she met with on her being\n",
      "   deluded back again, followed by a week's delirium, had hitherto\n",
      "   hindered her from prosecuting her intention.\n",
      "But, nevertheless,\n",
      "   having it still in her view to perform her promise as soon as she had\n",
      "   opportunity, she made minutes of every thing as it passed, in order to\n",
      "   help her memory:—'Which,' as she observes in one place, 'she could\n",
      "   less trust to since her late disorders than before.'\n",
      "In these\n",
      "   minutes, or book of memoranda, she observes, 'That having\n",
      "   apprehensions that Dorcas might be a traitress, she would have got\n",
      "   away while she was gone out to see for a coach; and actually slid down\n",
      "   stairs with that intent.\n",
      "'If I do escape, what may become of me, a poor, helpless, deserted creature!—Helpless from sex!—from circumstances!—Exposed to every danger!—Lord protect me!\n",
      "Yet the chariot was said to be ready at a grocer's not many doors off!\n",
      "for servants are fond of deriving collateral honours and distinctions, as I may call them, from the quality, or people of rank, whom they serve.\n",
      "May not the evil I know be less than what I may fall into, if I can avoid farther villany?\n",
      "At least, unless I can send this fellow away.\n",

      "\n",
      "* She tried to do this; but was prevented by the fellow's pretending to put his ankle out, by a slip down stairs—A trick, says his contriving master, in his omitted relation, I had taught him, on a like occasion, at Amiens.\n",
      "Disappointed in her meditated escape; obliged, against her will, to meet me in the dining-room; and perhaps apprehensive of being upbraided for her art in feigning herself ill; I expected that the dear perverse would begin with me with spirit and indignation.\n",
      "I felt for it in all my pockets, watching her eye mean time, which I saw glance towards the table where it lay.\n",
      "She took it, and cast her eye over it, in such a careless way, as made it evident, that she had read it before: and then unthankfully tossed it into the window-seat before her.\n",
      "A lady of your perfect character, Madam, who has feigned herself sick, on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored her, should not—\n",
      "\n",
      "I know what thou wouldst say, interrupted she—Twenty and twenty low things, that my soul would have been above being guilty of, and which I have despised myself for, have I been brought into by the infection of thy company, and by the necessity thou hadst laid me under, of appearing mean.\n",
      "Mere young-lady talk, when controuled by those they hate.\n",
      "'Thy curse, O my cruel father, seems to be now in the height of its operation!\n",

      "Forgive me only on this condition—That my future faith and honour—\n",
      "\n",
      "She interrupted me, rising—If you mean to beg of me never to seek to avenge myself by law, or by an appeal to my relations, to my cousin Morden in particular, when he comes to England——\n",
      "\n",
      "D—n the law, rising also, [she started,] and all those to whom you talk of appealing!—I defy both the one and the other—All I beg is YOUR forgiveness; and that you will, on my unfeigned contrition, re-establish me in your favour——\n",
      "\n",
      "O no, no, no!\n",
      "lifting up her clasped hands, I never never will, never, never can forgive you!—and it is a punishment worse than death to me, that I am obliged to meet you, or to see you.\n",
      "Passionate beauty!—still holding her—\n",
      "\n",
      "I speak, though with vehemence, the deliberate wish of my heart.—O that I could avoid looking down upon thee, mean groveler, and abject as insulting—Let me withdraw!\n",
      "However—But no more will I add—What a force have evil habits!—I will take an airing, and try to fly from myself!—Do not thou upbraid me on my weak fits—on my contradictory purposes—on my irresolution—and all will be well.\n",
      "A man is just now arrived from M. Hall, who tells me, that my Lord is in a very dangerous way.\n",
      "The fellow was sent upon other business; but stretched his orders a little, to make his court to a successor.\n",
      "The man says, that his Lordship was so bad when he came away, that the family began to talk of sending for me in post haste.\n",
      "I am afraid she will make me desperate.\n",
      "It may be bad; and then it would be hard to upbraid you, for a silence you may not be able to help.\n",
      "That this is his character, you will believe, when you are informed that he described you in grief excessive,* yet so improved in your person and features, and so rosy, that was his word, in your face, and so flush-coloured, and so plump in your arms, that one would conclude you were labouring under the operation of some malignant poison; and so much the rather, as he was introduced to you, when you were upon a couch, from which you offered not to rise, or sit up.\n",
      "But it must too: yet, it is strange I could not have one line by him:—not one:—and you so soon well enough to go with the wretch back again!\n",
      "I am not sure that the letter I am now writing will come to your hands: so shall not say half that I have upon my mind to say.\n",
      "She was ready dressed; for she had not her clothes off every since she declared, that they never more should be off in this house.\n",

      "It was impossible for me, I told her plainly, to comply.\n",
      "I could not live without her.\n",
      "I besought her to bless me with her consent; and, after the ceremony was passed, to accompany me down to Berks.\n",

      "She hesitated, and looked down, as if irresolute.\n",
      "And imaginest thou, fairest, thought I, that this will go down with a Lovelace?\n",
      "But, looking in her averted face with a soothing gentleness, I plainly perceived, that it was resentment, and not bashfulness, that was struggling in her bosom.\n",

      "But Dorcas soon roused me—Do you know, Sir, running in hastily, that my lady is gone down stairs!\n",
      "She then found her feet—O house [look towards the windows, and all round her, O house,] contrived on purpose for my ruin!\n",

      "A bad woman is certainly, Jack, more terrible to her own sex than even a bad man.\n",
      "She had reason* to think it would have been worse for her on the spot, if she had not made it.\n",
      "'He shall see,' says she, 'tame and timid as he thought me, what I dare to do, to avoid so hated a compulsion, and a man capable of a baseness so premeditatedly vile and inhuman.'\n",
      "But if one half of them is only intelligible, that will be enough to expose me to thy contempt, for the wretched hand I have made of my plots and contrivances.\n",
      "Thou couldst not provoke my anger, and my compassion thou ever hadst; and art now more especially entitled to it; because thou art a pityful fellow.\n",
      "The necessity I was under to go down to M. Hall was the subject I wanted to talk upon.\n",
      "I was plaguily nettled, and disappointed too.\n",

      "MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY, JULY 11.\n",
      "Forgive you, my dear!—Most cordially do I forgive you—Will you forgive me for some sharp things I wrote in return to your's of the 5th?\n",
      "As you are so earnest to have all the particulars of my sad story before you, I will, if life and spirits be lent me, give you an ample account of all that has befallen me, from the time you mention.\n",
      "Whither can I fly?—Perhaps my bad state of health (which must grow worse, as recollection of the past evils, and reflections upon them, grow heavier and heavier upon me) may be my protection.\n",
      "But just now, I will only say, that I would sooner suffer every evil (the repetition of the capital one excepted) than appear publicly in a court to do myself justice.\n",
      "You, who never loved my father, may think my solicitude on this head a weakness: but the motive for it, sunk as my spirits at times are, is not always weak.\n",
      "I excuse myself (on the score of the delirium, which the horrid usage I had received threw me into, and from a confinement as barbarous as illegal) that I had not before applied to Mrs. Moore for an account of what I was indebted to her: which account I now desired.\n",
      "In her answer, she tells me, 'that the vile wretch prevailed upon Mrs. Bevis to personate me, [a sudden motion of his, it seems, on the appearance of your messenger,] and persuaded her to lie along a couch: a handkerchief over her neck and face; pretending to be ill; the credulous woman drawn in by false notions of your ill offices to keep up a variance between a man and his wife—and so taking the letter from your messenger as me.\n",
      "'Miss Rawlins takes pains to excuse Mrs. Bevis's intention.\n",
      "How unhappy, that those letters only which could have acquainted me with his horrid views, and armed me against them, and against the vileness of the base women, should fall into his hands!—Unhappier still, in that my very escape to Hampstead gave him the opportunity of receiving them.\n",
      "He may glory in his contrivances—he, who has more wickedness than wit, may glory in his contrivances!—But, after all, I shall, I humbly presume to hope, be happy, when he, poor wretch, will be—alas!—who can say what!——\n",
      "\n",
      "Adieu, my dearest friend!—May you be happy!—And then your Clarissa cannot be wholly miserable!\n",
      "Is dreadfully apprehensive of her own safety from Mr. Lovelace.\n",
      "Half in jest, half in earnest, [as usual with him when vexed or disappointed,] he deplores the loss of her.—Humourous account of Lord M., of himself, and of his two cousins Montague.\n",
      "His Clarissa has made him eyeless and senseless to every other beauty.\n",
      "MARRIAGE, says he, with these women, is an atonement for the worst we can do to them; a true dramatic recompense.\n",
      "He makes several other whimsical, but characteristic observations, some of which may serve as cautions and warnings to the sex.\n"

      "And now he owns that the reason why Mr. Belford's letter set him into stronger ravings was, because of his keeping him wilfully (and on purpose to torment him) in suspense; and reflecting very heavily upon him, (for Mr. Belford, he says, was ever the lady's friend and advocate); and only mentioning, that he had waited upon her; referring to his next for further particulars; which Mr. Belford could have told him at the time.\n",
      "He declares, and we can vouch for him, that he has been, ever since last Saturday night, the most miserable of men.\n",

      "This last act, however unintended by thee, yet a consequence of thy general orders, and too likely to be thought agreeable to thee, by those who know thy other villanies by her, has finished thy barbarous work.\n",
      "She will not live to put thee to the trial; and it will a little palliate for thy enormous usage of her, and be a mean to make mankind, who know not what I know of the matter, herd a little longer with thee, and forbear to hunt thee to thy fellow-savages in the Lybian wilds and desarts.\n",
      "I sent apologies to them, as in a case of life and death; and speeded to town to the woman's: for how knew I but shocking attempts might be made upon her by the cursed wretches: perhaps by your connivance, in order to mortify her into your measures?\n",
      "Finding the lady not there, I posted away to the officer's, although Sally told me that she had but just come from thence; and that she had refused to see her, or (as she sent down word) any body else; being resolved to have the remainder of that Sunday to herself, as it might, perhaps, be the last she should ever see.\n"

      "I was afraid of sending up the name of a man known to be your friend.\n",
      "Having therefore informed myself of all that the officer, and his wife, and servant, could acquaint me with, as well in relation to the horrid arrest, as to her behaviour, and the women's to her; and her ill state of health; I went back to Sinclair's, as I will still call her, and heard the three women's story.\n",
      "From all which I am enabled to give you the following shocking particulars: which may serve till I can see the unhappy lady herself to-morrow, if then I gain admittance to her.\n",
      "Your villain it was that set the poor lady, and had the impudence to appear, and abet the sheriff's officers in the cursed transaction.\n",
      "She was terrified, trembled, and turned pale.\n",
      "men, what mean you?\n",
      "Must go with men!—I am not used to go with strange men!——Indeed you must excuse me!\n",
      "We can't excuse you.\n",
      "While some few threw out vile and shocking reflections!\n",
      "Indeed you must, said the other.\n",
      "I can write no more at present.\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "The unhappy lady fainted away when she was taken out of the chair at the officer's house.\n",
      "And who do you think, Miss Harlowe; for I understand, said the cursed creature, you are not married; who do you think is to pay for your board and your lodgings!\n",
      "for so long a time as you were at Mrs. Sinclair's?\n",
      "She stood astonished and silent for a few moments.\n",
      "After a pause, her handkerchief drying up her falling tears, she turned to Sally: Now, have I noting to do but acquiesce—only let me say, that if this aunt of your's, this Mrs. Sinclair, or this man, this Mr. Lovelace, come near me; or if I am carried to the horrid house; (for that, I suppose, is the design of this new outrage;) God be merciful to the poor Clarissa Harlowe!——Look to the consequence!——Look, I charge you, to the consequence!\n",
      "She cast up her eyes to Heaven, and was silent—and went to the farthest corner of the room, and, sitting down, threw her handkerchief over her face.\n",
      "She must be fasting—nothing but her prayers and tears, poor thing!—were the merciless devil's words, as she owned to me.—Dost think I did not curse her?\n",
      "The unhappy lady, by this devil's account of her, then seemed either mortified into meekness, or to have made a resolution not to be provoked by the insults of this cursed creature.\n",
      "Sally inquired, in her presence, whether she had eat or drank any thing; and being told by the woman, that she could not prevail upon her to taste a morsel, or drink a drop, she said, this is wrong, Miss Harlowe!\n",
      "Am I not worthy an answer, Miss Harlowe?\n",
      "The divine Clarissa, Lovelace,—reduced to rejoice for a cup of cold water!—By whom reduced?\n",
      "Their maid, if she pleased; or, as she was so weak and ill, the girl should sit up with her, if she chose she should.\n",
      "But might she not be trusted with the key of the room where she was to lie down; for she should not put off her clothes!\n",
      "She was afraid not, she said.—But indeed she would not get away, if she could.\n",
      "I suppose it is shocking enough.\n",
      "But she took no more notice of her than of the other.\n",
      "She meekly put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out half a guinea, and a little silver.\n",
      "These are very sad ones.\n",
      "There is what will pay for their lodgings and trouble: I shall not lessen their security.\n",
      "I have very few friends; and to those I have I will spare the mortification of knowing what has befallen me.\n",
      "I shall not live always.\n",
      "I am miserable!—What is liberty to the miserable, but to be more miserable.\n",
      "How miserable, Miss?—You may make yourself as happy as you please.\n",
      "Do you come hither to persuade me to hate prudery, as you call it, as much as you do?\n",
      "It is not in my inclination to trouble you.\n",
      "You may be worse offered.\n",
      "I had once a better opinion of you, Miss Horton!—Indeed you should not insult the miserable.\n",
      "Neither should the miserable, said Sally, insult people for their civility.\n",
      "I should be sorry if I did.\n",
      "Is it not better that you make it up?\n",
      "And down she dropt into her chair, and they could not get another word from her.\n",
      "She threw her handkerchief over her face, as one before, which was soon wet with tears; and grievously, they own, she sobbed.\n",
      "And I will continue the melancholy subject from the information of these wretches.\n",
      "Refusing any thing for breakfast, Mrs. Rowland came up to her, and told her, (as these wretches owned they had ordered her, for fear she should starve herself,) that she must and should have tea, and bread and butter: and that, as she had friends who could support her, if she wrote to them, it was a wrong thing, both for herself and them, to starve herself thus.\n",
      "If it be for your own sakes, said she, that is another thing: let coffee, or tea, or chocolate, or what you will, be got: and put down a chicken to my account every day, if you please, and eat it yourselves.\n",
      "They wondered, they told her, at her strange composure in such distresses.\n",
      "The disgrace of seizing her in the street; multitudes of people about her; shocking imputations wounding her ears; had indeed been very affecting to her.\n",
      "Don't push me upon extremities, man!—Don't make me desperate, woman!—I have no small difficulty, notwithstanding the seeming composure you just now took notice of, to bear, as I ought to bear, the evils I suffer.\n",
      "But if you bring a man or men to me, be the pretence what it will——\n",
      "\n",
      "She stopt there, and looked so earnestly, and so wildly, they said, that they did not know but she would do some harm to herself, if they disobeyed her; and that would be a sad thing in their house, and might be their ruin.\n",
      "Mrs. Rowland prevailed on her to drink a dish of tea, and taste some bread and butter, about eleven on Saturday morning: which she probably did to have an excuse not to dine with the women when they returned.\n",
      "You will have harder usage than any you have ever yet known, I can tell you, if you come not into some humour to make matters up.\n",
      "Come, Miss, walk down to dinner.\n",
      "Miss Harlowe: you are obliged to me, I can tell you that: and let us go down to Miss Horton.\n",
      "Excuse me: I will not stir out of this room.\n",
      "Would you have me and Miss Horton dine in this filthy bed-room?\n",
      "And yet you care not, as I see, to leave the house.—And so, you won't go down, Miss Harlowe?\n",
      "I won't, except I am forced to it.\n",
      "And away the little saucy toad fluttered down.\n",
      "She only held up her hands and eyes; the tears trickling down her cheeks.\n",
      "Insolent devils!—how much more cruel and insulting are bad women even than bad men!\n",
      "Methinks, Miss, said Sally, you are a little soily, to what we have seen you.\n",
      "Why won't you send to your lodgings for linen, at least?\n",
      "I am not nice now.\n",
      "Too much!—She tossed her handkerchief, wet before with her tears, from her, and held her apron to her eyes.\n",
      "Yet I cursed them not so much as I should have done, had I not had a mind to get from them all the particulars of their gentle treatment: and this for two reasons; the one, that I might stab thee to the heart with the repetition; and the other, that I might know upon what terms I am likely to see the unhappy lady to-morrow.\n",
      "She hoped she should never see you more: and, were you to intrude yourself, dreadful consequences might follow.\n",
      "She had the insolence to add, to the lady, That she had as much reason as she to expect Mr. Lovelace would marry her; he having contracted to do so before he knew Miss Clarissa Harlowe: and that she had it under his hand and seal too—or else he had not obtained his end: therefore it was not likely she should be so officious as to do his work against herself, if she thought Mr. Lovelace had designs upon her, like what she presumed to hint at: that, for her part, her only view was, to procure liberty to a young gentlewoman, who made those things grievous to her which would not be made such a rout about by any body else—and to procure the payment of a just debt to her friend Mrs. Sinclair.\n",
      "She wanted not these instances, she said, to convince her of the company she was in; and told them, that, to get rid of such visiters, and of the still worse she was apprehensive of, she would write to one friend to raise the money for her; though it would be death for her to do so; because that friend could not do it without her mother, in whose eye it would give a selfish appearance to a friendship that was above all sordid alloys.\n",
      "And, 'bating that he will take his advantage, where he can, of US silly credulous women, he is a man of honour.\n",
      "She had also a few other valuables; but no money, (none at all,) but the poor half guinea, and the little silver they had seen.\n",
      "She would give bond to pay all that her apparel, and the other maters she had, would fall short of.\n",
      "and, in my heart, thee!—But too probable, thought I, that this vile Sally Martin may hope, [though thou art incapable of it,] that her Lovelace, as she has the assurance, behind thy back, to call thee, may present her with some of the poor lady's spoils!\n",
      "And, let me ask thee, what now thou can'st think of thy barbarity, thy unprecedented barbarity, in having reduced a person of her rank, fortune, talents, and virtue, so low?\n",
      "Till I came, they thought thou wouldst not be displeased at any thing she suffered, that could help to mortify her into a state of shame and disgrace; and bring her to comply with thy views, when thou shouldst come to release her from these wretches, as from a greater evil than cohabiting with thee.\n",
      "When thou considerest these things, thou wilt make no difficulty of believing, that this their own account of their behaviour to this admirable woman has been far short of their insults: and the less, when I tell thee, that, all together, their usage had such effect upon her, that they left her in violent hysterics; ordering an apothecary to be sent for, if she should continue in them, and be worse; and particularly (as they had done from the first) that they kept out of her way any edged or pointed instrument; especially a pen-knife; which, pretending to mend a pen, they said, she might ask for.\n",
      "At twelve, Saturday night, Rowland sent to tell them, that she was so ill, that he knew not what might be the issue; and wished her out of his house.\n",
      "but she sent them down word that she must have all the remainder of the day to herself.\n",
      "Dorcas, whose acquaintance this fellow is, and who recommended him for the journey, had conditioned with him, it seems, for a share in the expected bounty from you.\n",
      "Under what shocking disadvantages, and with this addition to them, that I am thy friend and intimate, am I to make a visit to this unhappy lady to-morrow morning!\n",
      "I will close here; and take a little rest: what I have written will be a proper preparative for what shall offer by-and-by.\n",
      "If I find any difficulty in seeing the lady, thy messenger shall post away with this.—Let him look to broken bones, and other consequences, if what he carries answer not thy expectation.\n",
      "Rowland, upon inquiry, told me, that the lady was extremely ill; and that she had desired, that no one but his wife or maid should come near her.\n",
      "A horrid hole of a house, in an alley they call a court; stairs wretchedly narrow, even to the first-floor rooms: and into a den they led me, with broken walls, which had been papered, as I saw by a multitude of tacks, and some torn bits held on by the rusty heads.\n",
      "A bed at one corner, with coarse curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling; because the curtain-rings were broken off; but a coverlid upon it with a cleanish look, though plaguily in tatters, and the corners tied up in tassels, that the rents in it might go no farther.\n",
      "The windows dark and double-barred, the tops boarded up to save mending; and only a little four-paned eyelet-hole of a casement to let in air; more, however, coming in at broken panes than could come in at that.\n",
      "Near that, on the same shelf, was an old looking-glass, cracked through the middle, breaking out into a thousand points; the crack given it, perhaps, in a rage, by some poor creature, to whom it gave the representation of his heart's woes in his face.\n",
      "To finish the shocking description, in a dark nook stood an old broken-bottomed cane couch, without a squab, or coverlid, sunk at one corner, and unmortised by the failing of one of its worm-eater legs, which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer support.\n",
      "I had leisure to cast my eye on these things: for, going up softly, the poor lady turned not about at our entrance; nor, till I spoke, moved her head.\n",
      "was reclined, when we entered, upon her crossed arms; but so, as not more than one side of it could be hid.\n",
      "We are poor people—and we expect nobody will stay with us longer than they can help it.\n",
      "let me never, never more believe in man!\n",
      "Why then, Sir, [looking at me]—but why do you mock me in that humble posture!\n",
      "But take it, or not, laying it upon the table——you must withdraw, Sir: I am very ill.\n",
      "I would fain get a little rest, if I could.\n",
      "I find I am going to be bad again.\n",
      "And offering to rise, she sunk down through excess of weakness and grief, in a fainting fit.\n",
      "Why, Lovelace, was thou not present thyself?——Why dost thou commit such villanies, as even thou art afraid to appear in; and yet puttest a weaker heart and head upon encountering with them?\n",
      "I went down mean while; for the detestable woman had been below some time.\n",
      "She tried to wheedle me; but I renounced her; and, after she had dismissed the action, sent her away crying, or pretending to cry, because of my behaviour to her.\n",
      "I was afraid to do it.\n",
      "For 'twas plain, that she could not bear your name: your friend, and the company you have seen me in, were the words nearest to naming you she could speak: and yet I wanted to clear your intention of this brutal, this sordid-looking villany.\n",
      "But she cared not to answer her: and was so weak and low, that it was almost as much out of her power as inclination, the woman told me, to speak.\n",
      "And here, being obliged to give way to an indispensable avocation, I will make thee taste a little, in thy turn, of the plague of suspense; and break off, without giving thee the least hint of the issue of my further proceedings.\n",
      "Curse upon thy hard heart, thou vile caitiff!\n",
      "'tis impossible that Miss Harlowe should have ever suffered as thou hast made me suffer, and as I now suffer!\n",
      "how would I whip and spur, and harrow up thy clumsy sides, till I make thee a ready-roasted, ready-flayed, mess of dog's meat; all the hounds in the country howling after thee, as I drove thee, to wait my dismounting, in order to devour thee piece-meal; life still throbbing in each churned mouthful!\n"

      "She was sitting on the side of the broken couch, extremely weak and low; and, I observed, cared not to speak to the man: and no wonder; for I never saw a more shocking fellow, of a profession tolerably genteel, nor heard a more illiterate one prate—physician in ordinary to this house, and others like it, I suppose!\n",
      "As I am in black, he took me, at my entrance, I believe, to be a doctor; and slunk behind me with his hat upon his two thumbs, and looked as if he expected the oracle to open, and give him orders.\n",
      "I was excessively touched at these words, knowing thy baseness, and the reason she had for them.\n",
      "Madam, said I, I have a regard, a regard a gentleman ought to have, to my word; and whenever I forfeit it to you——\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, Sir, don't be angry with me.\n",
      "It is grievous to me to question a gentleman's veracity.\n",
      "I would give you, Madam, demonstration, if your grief and your weakness would permit it, that he has no hand in this barbarous baseness: and that he resents it as it ought to be resented.\n",
      "I was forced to turn my head away, and to take out my handkerchief.\n",
      "Again I wish thou hadst been there, that thou mightest have sunk down at her feet, and begun that moment to reap the effect of her generous wishes for thee; undeserving, as thou art, of any thing but perdition.\n",
      "And I expressed my surprize, that she should be unwilling to quit such a place as this; when it was more than probable that some of her friends, when it was known how bad she was, would visit her.\n",
      "She said the place, when she was first brought into it, was indeed very shocking to her: but that she had found herself so weak and ill, and her griefs had so sunk her, that she did not expect to have lived till now: that therefore all places had been alike to her; for to die in a prison, was to die; and equally eligible as to die in a palace, [palaces, she said, could have no attractions for a dying person:] but that, since she feared she was not so soon to be released, as she had hoped; since she was suffered to be so little mistress of herself here; and since she might, by removal, be in the way of her dear friend's letters; she would hope that she might depend upon the assurances I gave her of being at liberty to return to her last lodgings, (otherwise she would provide herself with new ones, out of my knowledge, as well as your's;) and that I was too much of a gentleman, to be concerned in carrying her back to the house she had so much reason to abhor, and to which she had been once before most vilely betrayed to her ruin.\n",
      "I withdrew; and took the opportunity to be civil to Rowland and his maid; for she found no fault with their behaviour, for what they were; and the fellow seems to be miserably poor.\n",
      "She gave the maid something; probably the only half-guinea she had: and then with difficulty, her limbs trembling under her, and supported by Mrs. Rowland, got down stairs.\n",
      "I doubt, Sir, said she, as she moved, I have behaved rudely to you: but, if you knew all, you would forgive me.\n",
      "I ordered my servant, (whose mourning made him less observable as such, and who had not been in the lady's eye,) to keep the chair in view; and to bring me word, how she did, when set down.\n",
      "The disgrace she cannot hide from herself, as she says in her letter to Lady Betty, she is not solicitous to conceal from the world!\n",
      "Does this not show, that revenge has very little sway in her mind; though she can retain so much proper resentment?\n",
      "And this is another excellence in this admirable woman's character: for whom, before her, have we met with in the whole sex, or in ours either, that knew how, in practice, to distinguish between REVENGE and RESENTMENT, for base and ungrateful treatment?\n",
      "Accordingly, I took coach to Smith's, and procured the lady, (to whom I sent up my compliments, and inquiries how she bore her removal,) ill as she sent down word she was, to give proper direction to Mrs. Smith: whom I took with me to Sinclair's: and who saw every thing looked out, and put into the trunks and boxes they were first brought in, and carried away in two coaches.\n",
      "Had I not been there, Sally and Polly would each of them have taken to herself something of the poor lady's spoils.\n",
      "For now, they say, you will assuredly marry; and your example will be followed by all your friends and companions—as the old one says, to the utter ruin of her poor house.\n",
      "Having sat up so late to finish and seal in readiness my letter to the above period, I am disturbed before I wished to have risen, by the arrival of thy second fellow, man and horse in a foam.\n",
      "Only let me repeat one thing, which perhaps I mentioned too slightly before.\n",
      "I had but a poor account of it: yet sent up my compliments.\n",
      "Mrs. Lovick gratified me with an account of a letter she had written from the lady's mouth to Miss Howe; she being unable to write herself with steadiness.\n",
      "It was to this effect; in answer, it seems, to her two letters, whatever were the contents of them:\n",
      "\n",
      "'That she had been involved in a dreadful calamity, which she was sure, when known, would exempt her from the effects of her friendly displeasure, for not answering her first; having been put under an arrest.—Could she have believed it?—That she was released but the day before: and was now so weak and so low, that she was obliged to account thus for her silence to her [Miss Howe's] two letters of the 13th and 16th: that she would, as soon as able, answer them—begged of her, mean time, not to be uneasy for her; since (only that this was a calamity which came upon her when she was far from being well, a load laid upon the shoulders of a poor wretch, ready before to sink under too heavy a burden) it was nothing to the evil she had before suffered: and one felicity seemed likely to issue from it; which was, that she would be at rest, in an honest house, with considerate and kind-hearted people; having assurance given her, that she should not be molested by the wretch, whom it would be death for her to see: so that now she, [Miss Howe,] needed not to send to her by private and expensive conveyances: nor need Collins to take precautions for fear of being dogged to her lodgings; nor need she write by a fictitious name to her, but by her own.'\n",
      "I was admitted into the dining-room, where she was sitting in an elbow-chair, in a very weak and low way.\n",
      "She made an effort to stand up when I entered; but was forced to keep her seat.\n",
      "You'll excuse me, Mr. Belford: I ought to rise to thank you for all your kindness to me.\n",
      "Her nurse and Mrs. Smith, who were present, took occasion to retire: and, when we were alone, You seem to be a person of humanity, Sir, said she: you hinted, as I was leaving my prison, that you were not a stranger to my sad story.\n",
      "My unhappy friend's account of her had entitled her to that.\n",
      "I then mentioned your grief, your penitence, your resolutions of making her all the amends that were possible now to be made her: and in the most earnest manner, I asserted your innocence as to the last villanous outrage.\n",
      "Her answer was to this effect—It is painful to me to think of him.\n",
      "That cannot be atoned for: nor palliated: this may: and I shall not be sorry to be convinced that he cannot be guilty of so very low a wickedness.——Yet, after his vile forgeries of hands—after his baseness in imposing upon me the most infamous persons as ladies of honour of his own family—what are the iniquities he is not capable of?\n",
      "I then attempted more particularly to clear you of having any hand in the vile Sinclair's officious arrest; a point she had the generosity to wish you cleared of: and, having mentioned the outrageous letter you had written to me on this occasion, she asked, If I had that letter about me?\n",
      "This puzzled me horribly: for you must needs think that most of the free things, which, among us rakes, pass for wit and spirit, must be shocking stuff to the ears or eyes of persons of delicacy of that sex: and then such an air of levity runs through thy most serious letters; such a false bravery, endeavouring to carry off ludicrously the subjects that most affect thee; that those letters are generally the least fit to be seen, which ought to be most to thy credit.\n",
      "In the next I omitted thy curse upon thy relations, whom thou wert gallanting: and read on the seven subsequent paragraphs down to thy execrable wish; which was too shocking to read to her.\n",
      "What I read produced the following reflections from her:\n",
      "\n",
      "'The plots and contrivances which he curses, and the exultings of the wicked wretches on finding me out, show me that all his guilt was premeditated: nor doubt I that his dreadful perjuries, and inhuman arts, as he went along, were to pass for fine stratagems; for witty sport; and to demonstrate a superiority of inventive talents!—O my cruel, cruel brother!\n",
      "I endeavoured, therefore, with some warmth, to clear myself of this reflection; and she again asked my excuse: 'I was avowedly, she said, the friend of a man, whose friendship, she had reason to be sorry to say, was no credit to any body.\n",
      "I did; but fared not much better afterwards: for on that passage where you say, I had always been her friend and advocate, this was her unanswerable remark: 'I find, Sir, by this expression, that he had always designs against me; and that you all along knew that he had.\n",
      "You seem an humane man: I hope, for your own sake, you will one day experience the difference: and, when you do, think of Miss Howe and Clarissa Harlowe, (I find you know much of my sad story,) who were the happiest creatures on earth in each other's friendship till this friend of your's'—And there she stopt, and turned from me.\n",
      "On that passage, where thou sayest, Let me know how she has been treated: if roughly, woe be to the guilty!\n",
      "this was her remark, with an air of indignation: 'What a man is your friend, Sir!—Is such a one as he to set himself up to punish the guilty?—All the rough usage I could receive from them, was infinitely less'—And there she stopt a moment or two: then proceeding—'And who shall punish him?\n",
      "I shall have this savage fellow think I have been playing him booty, in reading part of his letter to this sagacious lady!—Yet, if thou art angry, it can only, in reason, be at thyself; for who would think I might not communicate to her some of thy sincerity in exculpating thyself from a criminal charge, which thou wrotest to thy friend, to convince him of thy innocence?\n",
      "But a bad heart, and a bad cause are confounded things: and so let us put it to its proper account.\n",
      "You know his vile Tomlinson, I suppose—You know—But what signifies talking?—Never was there such a premeditated false heart in man, [nothing can be truer, thought I!]\n",
      "and all for what?—Only to ruin a poor young creature, whom he ought to have protected; and whom he had first deceived of all other protection!\n",
      "What could I say for thee?—There was no room, however, at that time, to touch this string again, for fear of bringing upon myself a prohibition, not only of the subject, but of ever attending her again.\n",
      "I gave some distant intimations of money-matters.\n",
      "Indeed I know not the person, man or woman, I should be so much afraid of disobliging, or incurring a censure from, as from her.\n",
      "that I should only accelerate the intended mischiefs.—Moreover, finding thee so much over-awed by her virtue, that thou hadst not, at thy first carrying her thither, the courage to attempt her; and that she had, more than once, without knowing thy base views, obliged thee to abandon them, and to resolve to do her justice, and thyself honour; I hardly doubted, that her merit would be triumphant at last.\n",
      "The lady, I really think, would choose death rather than thee: and the two women are of opinion, though they knew not half of what she has suffered, that her heart is actually broken.\n",
      "This morning I took a chair to Smith's; and, being told that the lady had a very bad night, but was up, I sent for her worthy apothecary; who, on his coming to me, approving of my proposal of calling in Dr. H., I bid the woman acquaint her with the designed visit.\n",
      "I named him for his eminence in his profession: and Mr. Goddard said he knew not a better physician.\n",
      "I suffer this visit, because I would not appear ungrateful to the few friends I have left, nor obstinate to such of my relations, as may some time hence, for their private satisfaction, inquire after my behaviour in my sick hours.\n",
      "'I am very ill!\n",

      "But, tired out with her headstrong ways, [I am sorry to say this of my own child,] I was forced to give way to it again.\n",
      "And, indeed, so sturdy was she in her will, that I was afraid it would end in a fit of sickness, as too often it did in fits of sullens.\n",

      "I believe, however, you will have no more such letters from my Nancy.\n",
      "I have been forced to use compulsion with her upon Miss Clary's illness, [and it seems she is very bad,] or she would have run away to London, to attend upon her: and this she calls doing the duty of a friend; forgetting that she sacrifices to her romantic friendship her duty to her fond indulgent mother.\n",

      "I long to have your answer to mine of the 13th.\n",
      "My mother promised the Colonel for me and herself, in my absence.\n",
      "And having had a few sparring blows with each other very lately, I think I must comply.\n",
      "I don't know, if either were not a little afraid of the other, whether it would be possible that we could live together:—I, all my father!—My mamma—What?—All my mother—What else should I say?\n",
      "This is that makes me, in the words of my admired exclaimer, very little altered, often repeat: 'Oh!\n",
      "that I were as in months past!\n",
      "Also your's of the 18th,* demanding me, as I may say, of those ladies, and of that family, when I was so infamously and cruelly arrested, and you knew not what was become of me.\n",
      "Thse, my dearest Miss Howe; and your letter of the 16th,* which came when I was under arrest, and which I received not till some days after; are all before me.\n",
      "'But you will expect my reasons; I know you will: and if I give them not, will conclude me either obstinate, or implacable, or both: and those would be sad imputations, if just, to be laid to the charge of a person who thinks and talks of dying.\n",
      "And yet, to say that resentment and disappointment have no part in my determination, would be saying a thing hardly to be credited.\n",
      "Do you think your Clarissa Harlowe so lost, so sunk, at least, as that she could, for the sake of patching up, in the world's eye, a broken reputation, meanly appear indebted to the generosity, or perhaps compassion, of a man, who has, by means so inhuman, robbed her of it?\n",
      "'Yes, I warrant, I must creep to the violator, and be thankful to him for doing me poor justice!\n",
      "'But, although thus much is due to resentment, yet have I not been so far carried away by its angry effects as to be rendered incapable of casting about what I ought to do, and what could be done, if the Almighty, in order to lengthen the time of my penitence, were to bid me to live.\n",
      "'The single life, at such times, has offered to me, as the life, the only life, to be chosen.\n",
      "But in that, must I not now sit brooding over my past afflictions, and mourning my faults till the hour of my release?\n",
      "'If I die not now, it may possibly happen that I may be taken when I am less prepared.\n",
      "'But now, my dear, for your satisfaction let me say that, although I wish not for life, yet would I not, like a poor coward, desert my post when I can maintain it, and when it is my duty to maintain it.\n",
      "'More than once, indeed, was I urged by thoughts so sinful: but then it was in the height of my distress: and once, particularly, I have reason to believe, I saved myself by my desperation from the most shocking personal insults; from a repetition, as far as I know, of his vileness; the base women (with so much reason dreaded by me) present, to intimidate me, if not to assist him!—O my dear, you know not what I suffered on that occasion!—Nor do I what I escaped at the time, if the wicked man had approached me to execute the horrid purposes of his vile heart.'\n",
      "I have reason to think my punishment is but the due consequence of my fault, and I will not run away from it; but beg of Heaven to sanctify it to me.\n",
      "A very little, you know, will do for that.\n",
      "Don't be concerned, my dear—But I am sure, if I may say it with as little presumption as grief, That God will soon dissolve my substance; and bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.'\n",
      "The letter accompanying this being upon a very particular subject, I would not embarrass it, as I may say, with any other.\n",
      "And yet having some farther matters upon my mind, which will want your excuse for directing them to you, I hope the following lines will have that excuse.\n",
      "I durst not mention it to you at that time, because appearances were so strong against me, on Mr. Lovelace's getting me again into his power, (after my escape to Hampstead,) as made you very angry with me when you answered mine on my second escape.\n",
      "And, soon afterwards, I was put under that barbarous arrest; so that I could not well touch upon the subject till now.\n"

      "The lady was so jealous that the money might come from you or me, that she would see the purchaser: who owned to Mrs. Lovick that she bought them for half their worth: but yet, though her conscience permitted her to take them at such an under rate, the widow says her friend admired the lady, as one of the loveliest of her sex: and having been let into a little of her story, could not help shedding tears at taking away her purchase.\n",
      "She may be a good sort of woman: Mrs. Lovick says she is: but SELF is an odious devil, that reconciles to some people the most cruel and dishonest actions.\n",

      "—To plunder a wreck, and to rob at a fire, are indeed higher degrees of wickedness: but do not those, as well as these, heighten the distresses of the distressed, and heap misery on the miserable, whom it is the duty of every one to relieve?\n",

      "Her grief, in short, seems to me to be of such a nature, that time, which alleviates most other person's afflictions, will, as the poet says, give increase to her's.\n",
      "She shot to the stairs-head to receive him, and, taking his hand, asked half a dozen questions (without waiting for any answer) in relation to Miss Howe's health; acknowledging, in high terms, her goodness in sending him to see her, before she set out upon her little journey.\n",
      "He was visibly shocked to see how ill she looked.\n",
      "He turned away his face, with visible grief in it.\n",
      "Mr. Hickman received my civilities with a coldness, which, however, was rather to be expected on your account, than that it deserved exception on mine.\n",
      "I left them together, and called upon Mr. Dorrell, my attorney, to consult him upon poor Belton's affairs; and then went home, and wrote thus far, preparative to what may occur in my breakfasting-visit in the morning.\n",
      "He spoke very little; for I suppose they had all their talk out yesterday, and before I came this morning.\n",
      "She asked how long it would be before they returned?\n",
      "And he told her, it was proposed to be no more than a fortnight out and in.\n",
      "At her desire he sat down with us.\n",
      "And let me tell you, Madam, that so much watching, so little nourishment, and so much grief, as you seem to indulge, is enough to impair the most vigorous health, and to wear out the strongest constitution.\n",
      "Let your breakfast be watergruel, or milk-pottage, or weak broths: your dinner any thing you like, so you will but eat: a dish of tea, with milk, in the afternoon; and sago for your supper: and, my life for your's, this diet, and a month's country air, will set you up.'\n",
      "It would be an unpardonable fault, and very ill become the character I would be glad to deserve, or the temper of mind I wish my friends hereafter to think me mistress of, if I did not.\n",
      "He told me that Miss Howe, and her mother, and himself, were to begin their little journey for the Isle of Wight on Monday next: but that he must make the most favourable representation of Miss Harlowe's bad health, or they should have a very uneasy absence.\n",
      "I thought it would serve no other end to mention it, but to shock Miss Howe: for it has such a sound with it, that a woman of her rank and fortune should be so reduced, that I cannot myself think of it with patience; nor know I but one man in the world who can.\n",
      "This gentleman is a little finical and formal.\n",
      "But you are really a strange mortal: because you have advantages in your person, in your air, and intellect, above all the men I know, and a face that would deceive the devil, you can't think any man else tolerable.\n",
      "Our early love of roguery makes us generally run away from instruction; and so we become mere smatterers in the sciences we are put to learn; and, because we will know no more, think there is no more to be known.\n",
      "He was excessively moved at taking leave of her; being afraid, as he said to me, (though he would not tell her so,) that he should never see her again.\n",
      "The occasion I will communicate to you by-and-by: for nothing but the flutters given by the stroke of death could divert my first attention from the sad and solemn contents of your last favour.\n",
      "You may excuse your relations.\n",
      "But, my dear, other people must be allowed to judge as they please.\n",
      "But if you are displeased with me for the freedoms I took so long ago as you mention, I am afraid, if you knew what passed upon an application I made to your sister very lately, (in hopes to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon,) that you would be still more concerned.\n",
      "But I have no example to the contrary but from you: and the treatment you meet with is very little encouragement to me to endeavour to imitate you in your dutiful meekness.\n",
      "my dear, I am so fearful of consequences, so selfishly fearful, if this negative must be given—I don't know what I should say—but give me leave to suspend, however, this negative till I hear from you again.\n",
      "I sat down and fanned myself, and was forced to order a glass of water.\n",
      "He entered with an air so hateful to me, but so agreeable to every other eye, that I could have looked him dead for that too.\n",
      "Little sins!\n",
      "replied Miss D'Oily: Mr. Lovelace's character is so well known, that nobody believes he can commit little sins.\n",
      "Then I am the only person to whom you are not very good: and so I am the less obliged to you.\n",
      "There had indeed been some late occasion given for mutual displeasure between my mother and me: but I think she might have spared this to him; though nobody heard it, I believe, but the person to whom it was spoken, and the lady who told it me; for my mother spoke it low.\n",
      "But, detaining her hand—Less severe, dear Madam, said he, be less severe in this place, I beseech you.\n",
      "But the place may as properly excuse this subject, as what you call my severity.\n",
      "And why, why this anger, dear Madam, (for she struggled to get her hand out of his,) these violent airs—so maidenly!\n",
      "Miss Arabella Harlowe, excuse me, Sir, said Miss Lloyd, would be very little inclined to meet you here, or any where else.\n",
      "Miss Harlowe, Sir, and Miss Biddulph, with a threatening air, will hardly be here without her brother.\n",
      "Then, turning round, as if desirous to find out the one or the other, he 'spied me, and with a very low bow, approached me.\n",
      "I went down from him to the other end of the room, and sat down, as I thought, out of his hated sight; but presently I heard his odious voice, whispering, behind my chair, (he leaning upon the back of it, with impudent unconcern,) Charming Miss Howe!\n",
      "I knew not what I did.—But I could have killed him.\n",
      "I am so conscious of my demerits, that I have no hope, but in your interposition—could I owe that favour to Miss Howe's mediation which I cannot hope for on any other account—\n",
      "\n",
      "My mediation, vilest of men!—My mediation!—I abhor you!—From my soul, I abhor you, vilest of men!—Three or four times I repeated these words, stammering too.—I was excessively fluttered.\n",
      "You can tell me nothing, Madam, so bad as I will call myself.\n",
      "Excuse me, Madam!\n",
      "To this it is that such vile fellows owe much of their vileness: whereas, if they found themselves shunned, and despised, and treated as beasts of prey, as they are, they would run to their caverns; there howl by themselves; and none but such as sad accident, or unpitiable presumption, threw in their way, would suffer by them.\n",
      "Unthinking eye-governed creatures!—Would not a little reflection teach us, that a man of merit must be a man of modesty, because a diffident one?\n",
      "The gentlemen were as ready as I to wish he had broken his neck, rather than been present, I believe: for nobody was regarded but he.\n",
      "My Lord M. and his two sisters are impatiently expecting the fruits of it.\n",
      "If I must speak on this subject, let me tell you that you have broken her heart.\n",
      "I then reproached him (with vehemence enough you may believe) on his baseness, and the evils he had made you suffer: the distress he had reduced you to; all your friends made your enemies: the vile house he had carried you to; hinted at his villanous arts; the dreadful arrest: and told him of your present deplorable illness, and resolution to die rather than to have him.\n",
      "He vindicated not any part of his conduct, but that of the arrest; and so solemnly protested his sorrow for his usage of you, accusing himself in the freest manner, and by deserved appellations, that I promised to lay before you this part of our conversation.\n"

      "for the usage she has received, (to say nothing of her disappointed pride, to which her death would be attributable, more than to reason,) what comparison will her fate hold to Queen Dido's?\n",
      "And have I half the obligation to her, that Æneas had to the Queen of Carthage?\n",

      "Again, thou art deprived of the force men of our cast give to arguments; for she won't let thee swear!-Art, moreover, a very heavy, thoughtless fellow; tolerable only at a second rebound; a horrid dunce at the impromptu.\n",
      "Knowest thou not that those words (so contrary to common experience) were applied to the case of a person, while passion was in its full vigour?—At such a time, every one in a heavy grief thinks the same: but as enthusiasts do by Scripture, so dost thou by the poets thou hast read: any thing that carries the most distant allusion from either to the case in hand, is put down by both for gospel, however incongruous to the general scope of either, and to that case.\n",

      "This will save thy word; and, as to mine, can she think worse of me than she does at present?\n",

      "All my vice is women, and the love of plots and intrigues; and I cannot but wonder how I fell into those shocking freedoms of speech; since, generally speaking, they are far from helping forward my main end: only, now-and-then, indeed, a little novice rises to one's notice, who seems to think dress, and oaths, and curses, the diagnostics of the rakish spirit she is inclined to favour: and indeed they are the only qualifications that some who are called rakes and pretty fellows have to boast of.\n",

      "When he sees you, he will be convinced that the most obliging things he can do, will be as proper to be done for the sake of his own future peace of mind, as for your health-sake; and, I dare say, in fear of hurting the latter, he will forbear the thoughts of any farther intrusion; at least while you are so much indisposed: so that one half-hour's shock, if it will be a shock to see the unhappy man, (but just got up himself from a dangerous fever,) will be all you will have occasion to stand.\n",

      "But a man cannot be ill, or vapourish, but thou liftest up thy shriek-owl note, and killest him immediately.\n",
      "Methinks I see thy clumsy sides shaking, (and shaking the sides of all beholders,) in these attitudes; thy fat head archly beating time on thy porterly shoulders, right and left by turns, as I once beheld thee practising to the horn-pipe at Preston.\n",
      "But I shall call thee seriously to account, when I see thee, for the extracts thou hast given the lady from my letters, notwithstanding what I said in my last; especially if she continue to refuse me.\n",
      "Nevertheless I won't anticipate, but proceed to write thee a longer letter than thou hast had from me for some time past.\n",
      "That thou mightest have as little notice as possible of the time I was resolved to be in town, I set out in my Lord's chariot-and-six yesterday, as soon as I had dispatched my letter to thee, and arrived in town last night: for I knew I could have no dependence on thy friendship where Miss Harlowe's humour was concerned.\n",
      "ready at hand in a new livery; up went the head; out rushed my honour; the woman behind the counter all in flutters, respect and fear giving due solemnity to her features, and her knees, I doubt not, knocking against the inside of her wainscot-fence.\n",
      "Sir, Sir, and please your Honour: [the woman is struck with my figure, thought I:] Miss Harlowe, Sir!\n",
      "There is, indeed, such a young lady lodges here—But, but—\n",
      "\n",
      "But, what, Madam?—I must see her.—One pair of stairs; is it not?— Don't trouble yourself—I shall find her apartment.\n",
      "I heard she was very ill—she is not able to go out in a coach.\n",
      "He is gone into the country to visit a sick friend.\n",
      "Well, and Mr. Belford wrote me word that she was exceeding ill. How then can she be gone out?\n",
      "O Sir, she is very ill; very ill, indeed—she could hardly walk to the coach.\n",
      "Belford, thought I, himself knew nothing of the time of my coming; neither can he have received my letter of yesterday: and so ill, 'tis impossible she would go out.\n",
      "You'll excuse me; but I must go up stairs myself.\n",
      "The mans said he never saw so uncivil a gentleman in his life.\n",
      "Hark thee, friend, said I; let me advise thee to be a little decent; or I shall teach thee a lesson thou never learnedst in all thy life.\n",
      "I stept back to the locked door: My dear Miss Harlowe, I beg of you to open the door, or I'll break it open;—pushing hard against it, that it cracked again.\n",
      "The man looked pale: and, trembling with his fright, made a plaguy long face; and called to one of his bodice-makers above, Joseph, come down quickly.\n",
      "Joseph came down: a lion's-face grinning fellow; thick, and short, and bushy-headed, like an old oak-pollard.\n",
      "But I only hummed a tune, traversed all the other apartments, sounded the passages with my knuckles, to find whether there were private doors, and walked up the next pair of stairs, singing all the way; John and Joseph, and Mrs. Smith, following me up, trembling.\n",
      "I looked round me there, and went into two open-door bed-chambers; searched the closets, and the passages, and peeped through the key-hole of another: no Miss Harlowe, by Jupiter!\n",
      "I said this on purpose to find out whether these people knew the lady's story; and had the answer I expected from Mrs. Smith—I believe not, Sir.\n",
      "What of that?—Why I'll tell thee: The man who has no children by his wife must put up with plain John.\n",
      "Why then, dame Smith, so much the worse for those who were obliged to keep you company.\n",
      "Come, Mrs. Smith, come John, (Master Smith I should say,) let's walk down, and give me an account where the lady is gone, and when she will return.\n",
      "So down stairs led I. John and Joseph (thought I had discharged the latter,) and my dame, following me, to show their complaisance to a stranger.\n",
      "I am sorry for that.\n",
      "Down I went, they paying diligent attendance on my steps.\n",
      "turned round with their backs to us, to hide their grinning, with each his fist in his mouth.\n",
      "Give him half a dozen, dame Smith.\n",
      "Pray, Sir, walk from behind the compter.\n",
      "I reached down the glass, and gave Will.\n",
      "He stalked towards me, his hands behind him, half willing, and half unwilling.\n",
      "I suddenly wrapt my arm round his neck.\n",
      "said the pollard-headed dog, struggling to get his head loose from under my arm, while my other hand was muzzling about his cursed chaps, as if I would take his teeth out.\n",
      "Master and Mistress Smith being afraid, I suppose, that I had a design upon Joseph's throat, because he was their champion, (and this, indeed, made me take the more notice of him,) coming towards me with countenances tragic-comical, I let him go.\n",
      "Joseph shook his ears; and with both hands stroked down, smooth as it would lie, his bushy hair; and looked at me as if he knew not whether he should laugh or be angry: but, after a stupid stare or two, stalked off to the other end of the shop, nodding his head at me as he went, still stroking down his hair; and took his stand by his master, facing about and muttering, that I was plaguy strong in the arms, and he thought would have throttled him.\n",
      "She, in anger, [no woman is homely in her own opinion,] threw down her penny; and I put it in my pocket.\n",
      "to the starers; and I ran to her from behind the compter, and, as she was making off, took her hand, and drew her into the shop; begging that she would be my customer; for that I had but just begun trade.\n",
      "said she, smiling; but a little surprised.\n",
      "No matter for opening them, said I: thy fingers, friend, are as stiff as drum-sticks.\n",
      "Push!—Thou'rt an awkward dog!\n",
      "I wonder such a pretty lady will be followed by such a clumsy varlet.\n",
      "The fellow said the gloves were too little.\n",
      "But come, here's a larger pair: try them, when thou gettest home; and let thy sweetheart, if thou hast one, mend the other, so take both.\n",
      "Madam, said I, and stepped behind the compter, bowing over it, now I hope you will buy something for yourself.\n",
      "Well, Mrs. Smith, with a grave air, I am heartily sorry Miss Harlowe is abroad.\n",
      "I have been very ill. She has almost broken my heart by her cruelty.\n",
      "But I will send my servant, to know if she will favour me with one half-hour's conversation; for, as soon as I get down, I shall set out for Dover, in my way to France, if I have not a countermand from her, who has the sole disposal of my fate.\n",
      "to go and change his clothes, and to disguise himself by putting on his black wig, and keeping his mouth shut; and then to dodge about Smith's, to inform himself of the lady's motions.\n",
      "Moreover I was rejoiced to find, by the lady's absence, and by her going out at six in the morning, that it was impossible she should be so ill as thou representest her to be; and this gave me still higher spirits.\n",
      "She, to pacify me, said she would show me a new face that would please me; since I would not see my Sally, who was dying with grief.\n",
      "She won't come down, replied she.\n",
      "I followed her up: and who should she be, but that little toad Sally!\n",
      "And, by Sally, one sees that art will generally so well supply the place of nature, that you shall not easily know the difference.\n",
      "They told me that you seldom came near them; that, when you did, you put on plaguy grave airs; would hardly stay five minutes; and did nothing but praise Miss Harlowe, and lament her hard fate.\n",
      "Yet I have promised Lord M. to be down in two or three days at farthest; for he is grown plaguy fond of me since I was ill.\n",
      "Mean time, I thought I would write to divert thee, while thou art of such importance about the dying; and as thy servant, it seems, comes backward and forward every day, perhaps I may send thee another letter to-morrow, with the particulars of the interview between the dear creature and me; after which my soul thirsteth.\n",
      "I must write on, to divert myself: for I can get no rest; no refreshing rest.\n",
      "She suffered herself to be overcome in my favour by the joint intercessions of Lord M., Lady Sarah, Lady Betty, and my two cousins Montague, who waited upon her in deep mourning; the ladies in long trains sweeping after them; Lord M. in a long black mantle trailing after him.\n",
      "'I myself, I thought, was upon my knees, with a sword in my hand, offering either to put it up in the scabbard, or to thrust it into my heart, as she should command the one or the other.\n"

      "The poor lady, Sir, went out yesterday, on purpose to avoid you.\n",
      "She was afraid you would come, when she heard you were recovered from your illness.\n",
      "Sir, what pity it is that so fine a gentleman should make such ill returns for God's goodness to him!\n",
      "It extremely incommoded her yesterday.\n",
      "We were forced to support her, she was so weak.\n",
      "whither can I go, Mrs. Smith?—Cruel, cruel man!—tell him I called him so, if he come again!—God give him that peace which he denies me!\n",
      "cried I; and looked down, and took out my handkerchief.\n",
      "I then gave over the hope of seeing her for this time, I was extremely chagrined at my disappointment, and at the account they gave of her ill health.\n",
      "I need not tell you, Mrs. Lovick, how much I have injured her, nor how much she suffers by her relations' implacableness, Mrs. Smith, that cuts her to the heart.\n",
      "You don't look like a hard-hearted gentleman!—How can you thus hunt and persecute a poor lady, whom none of her relations will look upon?\n",
      "Bad as the poor lady was last night, said she, she transcribed into her book a meditation on your persecuting her thus.\n",
      "Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man.\n",
      "Preserve me from the violent man.\n",
      "Preserve me from the violent man, who hath purposed to overthrow my goings.\n",
      "He hath smitten my life down to the ground.\n",
      "He hath made me dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.\n",
      "Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble.\n",
      "I have eaten ashes like bread; and mingled my drink with weeping:\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of thine indignation, and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.\n",
      "Why now, Mrs. Lovick, said I, when I had read this meditation, as she called it, I think I am very severely treated by the lady, if she mean me in all this.\n",
      "She says, that I am a violent man, and a wicked man.—That I have been so, I own: but I repent, and only wish to have it in my power to repair the injuries I have done her.\n",
      "The gin, the snare, the net, mean matrimony, I suppose—But is it a crime in me to wish to marry her?\n",
      "Would any other woman think it so?\n",
      "and choose to become a pelican in the wilderness, or a lonely sparrow on the house-top, rather than have a mate that would chirp about her all day and all night?\n",
      "She says, she has eaten ashes like bread—A sad mistake to be sure!—And mingled her drink with weeping—Sweet maudlin soul!\n",
      "She concludes with praying, that the desires of the wicked (meaning poor me, I doubt) may not be granted; that my devices may not be furthered, lest I exalt myself.\n",
      "But here, Mrs. Lovick, let me ask, as something is undoubtedly meant by the lonely sparrow on the house-top, is not the dear creature at this very instant (tell me truly) concealed in Mrs. Smith's cockloft?—What say you, Mrs. Lovick?\n",
      "Several other whimsical and light things I said [all I had for it!]\n",
      "In short, I told them, I must and would see her: but that it should be with all the respect and veneration that heart could pay to excellence like her's: and that I would go round to all the churches in London and Westminster, where there were prayers or service, from sun-rise to sun-set, and haunt their house like a ghost, till I had the opportunity my soul panted after.\n",
      "And thus ended our serious conversation.\n",
      "John was mainly civil to me now; won over a little by my serious talk, and the honour I professed for the lady.\n",
      "They all three wished matters could be made up between us: but still insisted that she could never get over her illness; and that her heart was broken.\n",
      "If thou wouldst be thought in earnest in thy wishes to move the poor lady in thy favour, thy ludicrous behaviour at Smith's, when it comes to be represented to her, will have a very consistent appearance; will it not?—I will, indeed, confirm in her opinion, that the grave is more to be wished-for, by one of her serious and pious turn, than a husband incapable either of reflection or remorse; just recovered, as thou art, from a dangerous, at least a sharp turn.\n",
      "I am extremely concerned for the poor unprotected lady.\n",
      "She was so excessively low and weak on Saturday, that I could not be admitted to her speech: and to be driven out of her lodgings, when it was fitter for her to be in bed, is such a piece of cruelty, as he only could be guilty of who could act as thou hast done by such an angel.\n",
      "Canst thou thyself say, on reflection, that it has not the look of a wicked and hardened sportiveness, in thee, for the sake of a wanton humour only, (since it can answer no end that thou proposest to thyself, but the direct contrary,) to hunt from place to place a poor lady, who, like a harmless deer, that has already a barbed shaft in her breast, seeks only a refuge from thee in the shades of death.\n",
      "For, Lovelace, let this truth, this undoubted truth, be engraved on thy memory, in all thy gaieties, That the life we are so fond of is hardly life; a mere breathing space only; and that, at the end of its longest date,\n",
      "\n",
      "      Thou must die, as well as Belton.\n",
      "Thou knowest, by Tourville, what we had done as to the poor man's worldly affairs; and that we had got his unhappy sister to come and live with him (little did we think him so very near to his end): and so I will proceed to tell thee, that when I arrived at his house on Saturday night, I found him excessively ill: but just raised, and in his elbow-chair, held up by his nurse and Mowbray (the roughest and most untouched creature that ever entered a sick man's chamber); while the maid-servants were trying to make that bed easier for him which he was to return to; his mind ten times uneasier than that could be, and the true cause that the down was no softer to him.\n",
      "said the poor man.\n",
      "See how weak!\n",
      "Do you know your poor friend Belton?\n",
      "But I see you are weak; very weak—and I am sorry for it.\n",
      "Weak, weak, indeed, my dearest Belford, said he, and weaker in mind, if possible, than in body; and wept bitterly—or I should not thus unman myself.\n",
      "I, who never feared any thing, to be forced to show myself such a nursling!—I am quite ashamed of myself!—But don't despise me; dear Belford, don't despise me, I beseech thee.\n",
      "However, I could not help being visibly moved at the poor fellow's emotion.\n",
      "Now, said the brutal Mowbray, do I think thee insufferable, Jack.\n",
      "Our poor friend is already a peg too low; and here thou art letting him down lower and lower still.\n",
      "Then turning to the poor sick man, Tears, my dear Belton, are no signs of an unmanly, but, contrarily of a humane nature; they ease the over-charged heart, which would burst but for that kindly and natural relief.\n",
      "Give sorrow words (says Shakspeare)\n",
      "      —The grief that does not speak,\n",
      "      Whispers the o'er-fraught heart, and bids it break.\n",
      "I know, my dear Belton, thou usedst to take pleasure in repetitions from the poets; but thou must be tasteless of their beauties now: yet be not discountenanced by this uncouth and unreflecting Mowbray, for, as Juvenal says, Tears are the prerogative of manhood.\n",
      "'Tis at least seasonably said, my dear Belford.\n",
      "Ay, but, Mowbray, replied the poor man, those wretches have not had their minds enervated by such infirmities of body as I have long laboured under.\n",
      "Thou art a shocking fellow, and ever wert.—But to be able to remember nothing in these moments but what reproaches me, and to know that I cannot hold it long, and what may then be my lot, if—but interrupting himself, and turning to me, Give me thy pity, Jack; 'tis balm to my wounded soul; and let Mowbray sit indifferent enough to the pangs of a dying friend, to laugh at us both.\n",
      "The hardened fellow then retired, with the air of a Lovelace; only more stupid; yawning and stretching, instead of humming a tune as thou didst at Smith's.\n",
      "I assisted to get the poor man into bed.\n",
      "He was so weak and low, that he could not bear the fatigue, and fainted away; and I verily thought was quite gone.\n",
      "This put me strongly in mind of what the divine Miss HARLOWE once said to me, talking of friendship, and what my friendship to you required of me: 'Depend upon it, Mr. Belford,' said she, 'that one day you will be convinced, that what you call friendship, is chaff and stubble; and that nothing is worthy of that sacred name,\n",
      "\n",
      "      'That has not virtue for its base.'\n",
      "Sunday morning, I was called up at six o'clock, at the poor man's earnest request, and found him in a terrible agony.\n",
      "Then clasping my arm with both his hands, and rearing up his head towards me, his eyes strangely rolling, Save me!\n",
      "I put my other arm about him—Save you from what, my dear Belton!\n",
      "Recovering from his terror, he sunk down again, O save me from myself!\n",
      "What would I give for one year of my past life?—only one year—and to have the same sense of things that I now have?\n",
      "I tried to comfort him as well as I could: but free-livers to free-livers are sorry death-bed comforters.\n",
      "Now, that you are in full vigour of mind and body!—But your poor Belton, alas!\n",
      "your poor Belton kept his vices, till they left him—and see the miserable effects in debility of mind and despondency!\n",
      "But hadst thou heard what the poor dying Belton said on this occasion, perhaps it would have made thee serious an hour or two, at least.\n",
      "'When poor Lovelace is brought,' said he, 'to a sick-bed, as I am now, and his mind forebodes that it is impossible he should recover, (which his could not do in his late illness: if it had, he could not have behaved so lightly in it;) when he revolves his past mis-spent life; his actions of offence to helpless innocents; in Miss Harlowe's case particularly; what then will he think of himself, or of his past actions?\n",
      "his mind debilitated; his strength turned into weakness; unable to stir or to move without help; not one ray of hope darting in upon his benighted soul; his conscience standing in the place of a thousand witnesses; his pains excruciating; weary of the poor remnant of life he drags, yet dreading, that, in a few short hours, his bad will be changed to worse, nay, to worst of all; and that worst of all, to last beyond time and to all eternity; O Jack!\n",
      "what will he then think of the poor transitory gratifications of sense, which now engage all his attention?\n",
      "I can now neither repent, nor pray, as I ought; my heart is hardened, and I can do nothing but despair!—\n",
      "\n",
      "More he would have said; but, overwhelmed with grief and infirmity, he bowed his head upon his pangful bosom, endeavouring to hide from the sight of the hardened Mowbray, who just then entered the room, those tears which he could not restrain.\n",
      "Prefaced by a phlegmatic hem; sad, very sad, truly!\n",
      "cried Mowbray; who sat himself down on one side of the bed, as I sat on the other: his eyes half closed, and his lips pouting out to his turned-up nose, his chin curdled [to use one of thy descriptions]; leaving one at a loss to know whether stupid drowsiness or intense contemplation had got most hold of him.\n",
      "For up started Mowbray, writhing and shaking himself as in an ague-fit; his hands stretched over his head—with thy hoy!\n",
      "cried he; pulling out his watch—and stalking by long tip-toe strides through the room, down stairs he went; and meeting the maid in the passage, I heard him say—Betty, bring me a bumper of claret; thy poor master, and this d——d Belford, are enough to throw a Hercules into the vapours.\n",

      "I must repeat, That I cannot but be very uneasy for the poor lady whom you so cruelly persecute; and that I do not think that you have kept your honour with me.\n",
      "But she could not, it is plain, bear the shock of it: and indeed she told me that she would not see you, though but for one half-hour, for the world.\n",
      "I desire you to return it; and I'll give you a copy of it upon demand; for I intend to keep it by me, as a guard against the infection of your company, which might otherwise, perhaps, some time hence, be apt to weaken the impressions I always desire to have of the awful scene before me.\n",
      "Here, this vile Harry, who might have brought your letter of yesterday in good time, came not in with it till past eleven at night (drunk, I suppose); and concluding that I was in bed, as he pretends (because he was told I sat up the preceding night) brought it not to me; and having overslept himself, just as I had sealed up my letter, in comes the villain with the forgotten one, shaking his ears, and looking as if he himself did not believe the excuses he was going to make.\n",
      "He has not done cursing him yet; for stalking about the court-yard with his boots on, (the poor fellow dressing his horse, and unable to get from him,) he is at him without mercy; and I will heighten his impatience, (since being just under the window where I am writing, he will not let me attend to my pen,) by telling you how he fills my ears as well as the fellow's, with his—Hay, Sir!\n",
      "The poor horse suffers for this, I doubt not; for, What now!\n",
      "I hear the fellow is just escaped, the horse, (better curried than ordinary, I suppose, in half the usual time,) by his clanking shoes, and Mowbray's silence, letting me know, that I may now write on: and so, I will tell thee that, in the first place, (little as I, as well as you, regard dreams,) I would have thee lay thine to heart; for I could give thee such an interpretation of it, as would shock thee, perhaps; and if thou askest me for it, I will.\n",
      "Mowbray calls to me from the court-yard, that 'tis a cursed hot day, and he shall be fried by riding in the noon of it: and that poor Belton longs to see me.\n",
      "And if the poor fellow can spare thee, make haste, I command thee, to attend this truly divine lady.\n",
      "Thou mayest not else see her of months perhaps; at least, not while she is Miss HARLOWE.\n",
      "The welcomes, thrice repeated, are those of her family, now no more to be deemed implacable.\n",

      "Merely to die, no man of reason fears, is a mistake, say thou, or say thy author, what ye will.\n",

      "Well, but now my heart is a little at ease, I will condescend to take brief notice of some other passages in thy letters.\n",
      "The art of governing these underbred varlets lies more in the dignity of looks than in words; and thou art a sorry fellow, to think humanity consists in acting by thy servants, as men must act who are not able to pay them their wages; or had made them masters of secrets, which, if divulged, would lay them at the mercy of such wretches.\n",
      "If, indeed, I am out of the way a little, I always take care to rewards the varlets for patiently bearing my displeasure.\n",
      "But this I hardly ever am but when a fellow is egregiously stupid in any plain point of duty, or will be wiser than his master; and when he shall tell me, that he thought acting contrary to my orders was the way to serve me best.\n",
      "One time or other I will enter the lists with thee upon thy conduct and mine to servants; and I will convince thee, that what thou wouldst have pass for humanity, if it be indiscriminately practised to all tempers, will perpetually subject thee to the evils thou complainest of; and justly too; and that he only is fit to be a master of servants, who can command their attention as much by a nod, as if he were to pr'ythee a fellow to do his duty, on one hand, or to talk of flaying, and horse-whipping, like Mowbray, on the other: for the servant who being used to expect thy creeping style, will always be master of his master, and he who deserves to be treated as the other, is not fit to be any man's servant; nor would I keep such a fellow to rub my horse's heels.\n",
      "I shall be the readier to enter the lists with thee upon this argument, because I have presumption enough to think that we have not in any of our dramatic poets, that I can at present call to mind, one character of a servant of either sex, that is justly hit off.\n",
      "I shall be afraid to open thy next, lest it bring me the account of poor Belton's death.\n",
      "Yet, as there are no hopes of his recovery—but what should I say, unless the poor man were better fitted—but thy heavy sermon shall not affect me too much neither.\n",
      "I enclose thy papers; and do thou transcribe them for me, or return them; for there are some things in them, which, at a proper season, a mortal man should not avoid attending to; and thou seemest to have entered deeply into the shocking subject.—But here I will end, lest I grow too serious.\n",
      "Yet I must be at Lord M.'s to-morrow night, if possible, though ever so late.\n",
      "Thy fellow tells me the poor man is much as he was when Mowbray left him.\n",
      "As soon as I had seen Mowbray mounted, I went to attend upon poor Belton; whom I found in dreadful agonies, in which he awoke, after he generally does.\n",
      "I cannot die, said the poor man—I cannot think of dying.\n",
      "I am very desirous of living a little longer, if I could but be free from these horrible pains in my stomach and head.\n",
      "Alas!\n",
      "Sir, replied his physician, you have been long in a bad way.\n",
      "He was then out of all patience: What, then, is your art, Sir?—I have been a passive machine for a whole twelvemonth, to be wrought upon at the pleasure of you people of the faculty.—I verily believe, had I not taken such doses of nasty stuff, I had been now a well man—But who the plague would regard physicians, whose art is to cheat us with hopes while they help to destroy us?—And who, not one of you, know any thing but by guess?\n",
      "And I used to believe him too—and yet, fond of life, and fearful of death, what do we do, when we are taken ill, but call ye in?\n",
      "and then ye come creeping with solemn faces, when ye are ashamed to prescribe, or when the stomach won't bear its natural food, by reason of your poisonous potions,—Alas, I am afraid physic can do no more for him!—Nor need it, when it has brought to the brink of the grave the poor wretch who placed all his reliance in your cursed slops, and the flattering hopes you gave him.\n",
      "I blamed the poor man; yet excused him to the physician.\n",
      "To die, dear Doctor, when, like my poor friend, we are so desirous of life, is a melancholy thing.\n",
      "Well, Sir, said the poor angry man, vexed at the doctor, but more at death, you will perhaps recommend the next succession to the physician, when he can do no more; and, I suppose, will send your brother to pray by me for those virtues which you wish me.\n",
      "I was greatly concerned to see the gentleman thus treated; and so I told poor Belton when he was gone; but he continued impatient, and would not be denied, he said, the liberty of talking to a man, who had taken so many guineas of him for doing nothing, or worse than nothing, and never declined one, though he know all the time he could do him no good.\n",
      "and poor Belton went on raving at the extravagant fees of English physicians, compared with those of the most eminent foreign ones.\n",
      "But, poor man!\n",
      "The golden fee finds the ready hand, and they hurry away, as if the sick man's room were infectious.\n",
      "Mrs. Sambre (Belton's sister) had several times proposed to him a minister to pray by him, but the poor man could not, he said, bear the thoughts of one; for that he should certainly die in an hour or two after; and he was willing to hope still, against all probability, that he might recover; and was often asking his sister if she had not seen people as bad as he was, who, almost to a miracle, when every body gave them over, had got up again?\n",
      "And yet, poor fellow, he has no hopes himself, as is plain by his desponding terrors; one of which he fell into, and a very dreadful one, soon after the doctor went.\n",
      "The poor man had been in convulsions, terrible convulsions!\n",
      "for an hour past.\n",
      "Lovelace, death is a shocking thing!\n",
      "It is not merely the concern a man has for his friend; but, as death is the common lot, we see, in his agonies, how it will be one day with ourselves.\n",
      "I am all over as if cold water were poured down my back, or as if I had a strong ague-fit upon me.\n",
      "And I write, hardly knowing what.—I wish thou wert here.\n",
      "Poor Belton!—Drawing on apace!\n",
      "Yet was he sensible when I went in—too sensible, poor man!\n",
      "He has something upon his mind to reveal, he tells me, that is the worst action of his life; worse than ever you or I knew of him, he says.\n",
      "It must then be very bad!\n",
      "All now must soon be over with him: Poor, poor fellow!\n",
      "He has given me some hints of what he wanted to say; but all incoherent, interrupted by dying hiccoughs and convulsions.\n",
      "Bad enough it must be, Heaven knows, by what I can gather!—Alas!\n",
      "If a man were to live always, he might have some temptation to do base things, in order to procure to himself, as it would then be, everlasting ease, plenty, or affluence; but, for the sake of ten, twenty, thirty years of poor life to be a villain—Can that be worth while?\n",
      "And when he comes to wind up all, such agonizing reflections upon his past guilt!\n",
      "and not one thing to think of, as the poor fellow says twenty and twenty times over, but what is attended with anguish and reproach!—\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear the poor man wish he had never been born!—To hear him pray to be nothing after death!\n",
      "how shocking!\n",
      "By his incoherent hints, I am afraid 'tis very bad with him.\n",
      "They roll ghastly no more; are quite set; his face distorted, and drawn out, by his sinking jaws, and erected staring eyebrows, with his lengthened furrowed forehead, to double its usual length, as it seems.\n",
      "It is not, it cannot be the face of Belton, thy Belton, and my Belton, whom we have beheld with so much delight over the social bottle, comparing notes, that one day may be brought against us, and make us groan, as they very lately did him—that is to say, while he had strength to groan; for now his voice is not to be heard; all inward, lost; not so much as speaking by his eyes; yet, strange!\n",
      "Alas: he's gone!\n",
      "that groan, that dreadful groan,\n",
      "      Was the last farewell of the parting mind!\n",
      "The struggling soul has bid a long adieu\n",
      "      To its late mansion—Fled!\n",
      "Now is all indeed over!—Poor, poor Belton!\n",
      "now do we, thy friends,—poor Belton!— know the worst of thee, as to this life!\n",
      "I hope, therefore, as thou wert not cut off in the midst of thy sins by the sword of injured friendship, which more than once thou hadst braved, [the dreadfullest of all deaths, next to suicide, because it gives no opportunity for repentance] that this is a merciful earnest that thy penitence is accepted; and that thy long illness, and dreadful agonies in the last stages of it, were thy only punishment.\n",
      "But all, alas!\n",
      "I will therefore close with a few words upon the only subject in your letter which I can at present touch upon: and this is the letter of which you give me a copy from the lady.\n",
      "Want of rest, and the sad scene I have before my eyes, have rendered me altogether incapable of accounting for the contents of it in any shape.\n",
      "Poor Belton!\n",
      "how many poor wretches will rejoice at the occasion, (if they know it,) however melancholy in itself, which shall bring them in a compensation for injuries they had been forced to sit down contented with!\n",
      "Not I, Jack: I do not take it to be a laughing subject: and I am heartily concerned at the loss we all have in poor Belton: and when I get a little settled, and have leisure to contemplate the vanity of all sublunary things (a subject that will now-and-then, in my gayest hours, obtrude itself upon me) it is very likely that I may talk seriously with thee upon these topics; and, if thou hast not got too much the start of me in the repentance thou art entering upon, will go hand-in-hand with thee in it.\n",
      "Mean time, take back thy letter, as thou desirest.\n",
      "Mowbray and I will drop a tear a-piece, as we ride along, to the memory of poor Belton:—as we ride along, said I: for we shall have so much joy when we arrive at Lord M.'s, and when I communicate to him and my cousins the dear creature's letter, that we shall forget every thing grievous: since now their family-hopes in my reformation (the point which lies so near their hearts) will all revive; it being an article of their faith, that if I marry, repentance and mortification will follow of course.\n",
      "And as to the respect that is supposed to be shown to the memory of a deceased friend in such an attendance, why should we do any thing to reflect upon those who have made it a fashion to leave this parade to people whom they hire for that purpose?\n",
      "Thou canst now do no more for poor Belton, wert thou to howl for him to the end of thy life.\n",
      "On Thursday afternoon I assisted at the opening of poor Belton's will, in which he has left me his sole executor, and bequeathed me a legacy of an hundred guineas; which I shall present to his unfortunate sister, to whom he has not been so kind as I think he ought to have been.\n",
      "After I had given some particular orders about the preparations to be made for his funeral, I went to town; but having made it late before I got in on Thursday night, and being fatigued for want of rest several nights before, and now in my spirits, [I could not help it, Lovelace!]\n",
      "It is impossible to account for the contents of her letter to you; or to reconcile those contents to the facts I have to communicate.\n",
      "I was at Smith's by seven yesterday (Friday) morning; and found that the lady was just gone in a chair to St. Dunstan's to prayers: she was too ill to get out by six to Covent-garden church; and was forced to be supported to her chair by Mrs. Lovick.\n",
      "Mrs. Lovick, dreading that she would be taken worse at church, walked thither before her.\n",
      "Mrs. Smith told me she was so ill on Wednesday night, that she had desired to receive the sacrament; and accordingly it was administered to her, by the parson of the parish: whom she besought to take all opportunities of assisting her in her solemn preparation.\n",
      "He staid with her about half an hour; and when he came down, with his face turned aside, and a faltering accent, 'Mrs.\n",
      "Mrs. Smith told me that two different persons had called there, one on Thursday morning, one in the evening, to inquire after her state of health; and seemed as if commissioned from her relations for that purpose; but asked not to see her, only were very inquisitive after her visiters: (particularly, it seems, after me: What could they mean by that?)\n",
      "He shook his head, and said if she died, the flower of the world would be gone, and the family she belonged to would be no more than a common family.\n",
      "You may be curious to know how she passed her time, when she was obliged to leave her lodging to avoid you.\n",
      "Mrs. Smith tells me 'that she was very ill when she went out on Monday morning, and sighed as if her heart would break as she came down stairs, and as she went through the shop into the coach, her nurse with her, as you had informed me before: that she ordered the coachman (whom she hired for the day) to drive any where, so it was into the air: he accordingly drove her to Hampstead, and thence to Highgate.\n",
      "There at the Bowling-green House, she alighted, extremely ill, and having breakfasted, ordered the coachman to drive very slowly any where.\n",
      "He crept along to Muswell-hill, and put up at a public house there; where she employed herself two hours in writing, though exceedingly weak and low, till the dinner she had ordered was brought in: she endeavoured to eat, but could not: her appetite was gone, quite gone, she said.\n",
      "When she awoke, she ordered the coachman to drive her very slowly to town, to the house of a friend of Mrs. Lovick; whom, as agreed upon, she met there: but, being extremely ill, she would venture home at a late hour, although she heard from the widow that you had been there; and had reason to be shocked at your behaviour.\n",
      "She heard the relation of your astonishing vagaries, with hands and eyes often lifted up; and with these words intermingled, Shocking creature!\n",

      "But I find to what your uncle Antony's cruel letter is owing, as well as one you will be still more afflicted by, [God help you, my poor dear child!]\n",
      "Something of this nature was hinted at by Betty to me before, but so darkly that I could not tell what to make of it; and this made me mention to you so generally as I did in my last.\n",

      "After I had sealed up the enclosed, I had the honour of a private visit from your aunt Hervey; who has been in a very low-spirited way, and kept her chamber for several weeks past; and is but just got abroad.\n",
      "'That nobody knew the pangs which their inflexible behaviour gave them, ever since you had begun to write to them in so affecting and humble a style.\n",
      "'That, however, they were not inclined to believe that you were either so ill, or so penitent as you really are; and still less, that Mr. Lovelace is in earnest in his offers of marriage.\n",
      "'It had always,' she said, 'been matter of astonishment to her, that so weak a pride in her cousin James, of making himself the whole family, should induce them all to refuse an alliance with such a family as Mr. Lovelace's was.\n",
      "'She would have it, that your going off with Mr. Lovelace was the unhappiest step for your honour and your interest that could have been taken; for that although you would have had a severe trial the next day, yet it would probably have been the last; and your pathetic powers must have drawn you off some friends—hinting at your mother, at your uncle Harlowe, at your uncle Hervey, and herself.'\n",
      "'She owned, that some of them were as much afraid of meeting you as you could be of meeting them:'—But why so, if they designed, in the last instance, to give you your way?\n",
      "Your aunt referred her to your mother: but had heard no more of it.\n",
      "Your aunt says, 'That she then being very ill, wrote to your mother upon it, hoping it would not be taken amiss if she permitted Dolly to go; but that your sister, as from your mother, answered her, That now you seemed to be coming-to, and to have a due sense of your faults, you must be left entirely to their own management.\n",
      "But shall we wonder that kings and princes meet with so little controul in their passions, be they every so violent, when, in a private family, an aunt, nay, even a mother in that family, shall choose to give up a once-favoured child against their own inclinations, rather than oppose an aspiring young man, who had armed himself with the authority of a father, who, when once determined, never would be expostulated with?\n",
      "And yet so petulantly perverse am I, that I must tear myself from the subject.\n",
      "All then that I will say further to it, at this time, is, that were the intended goodness to be granted to me but a week hence, it would possibly be too late—too late I mean to be of the consolation to me that I would wish from it: for what an inefficacious preparation must I have been making, if it has not, by this time, carried me above—But above what?— Poor mistaken creature!\n",
      "Unhappy self-deluder!\n",
      "I am very sorry that my cousin Morden has taken a resolution to see Mr. Lovelace.\n",
      "But if the scandal arise solely from Mr. Belford's visits, a very little time will confute it.\n",
      "Mean while, the packet I shall send you, which I sent to Miss Howe, will, I hope, satisfy you, my dear Mrs. Norton, as to my reasons for admitting his visits.\n",
      "I will break off, with requesting your prayers that I may be blessed with patience and due resignation; and with assuring you, that I am, and will be to the last hour of my life,\n",

      "Your equally grateful and affectionate CL.\n",
      "I have been forced to mortify him no less than four times since we have been here.\n",
      "I made him lately undergo a severe penance for some negligences that were not to be passed over.\n",
      "I would not see him for two days, and he was so penitent, and so humble, that I had like to have lost myself, to make him amends: for, as you have said, resentment carried too high, often ends in amends too humble.\n",
      "I long to be nearer to you: but that must not yet be, it seems.\n",
      "Excuse me that I did not write before: it was owing to a little\n",
      "      coasting voyage I was obliged to give into.\n",
      "I am sure it was not your intention to take your future husband with you to the little island to make him look weak and silly among those of your relations who never before had seen him.\n",
      "Yet do you think it possible for them (however prepared and resolved they may be to like him) to forbear smiling at him, when they see him suffering under your whimsical penances?\n",
      "I gave you expectations that I would be very serious with you.\n",
      "Mr. Lovelace, it is now plain, in order to have a pretence against me, taxed my behaviour to him with stiffness and distance.\n",
      "You, at one time, thought me guilty of some degree of prudery.\n",
      "Difficult situations should be allowed for: which often make seeming occasions for censure unavoidable.\n",
      "I deserved not blame from him who made mine difficult.\n",
      "And you, my dear, had I any other man to deal with, or had he but half the merit which Mr. Hickman has, would have found that my doctrine on this subject should have governed my practice.\n",
      "But to put myself out of the question—I'll tell you what I should think, were I an indifferent by-stander, of those high airs of your's, in return for Mr. Hickman's humble demeanour.\n",

      "I will also enclose the rough draught of my answer, as soon as I have transcribed it.\n",
      "Every body has heard that you have been vilely treated by a man who, to treat you ill, must be the vilest of men.\n",
      "Every body knows your just resentment of his base treatment: that you are determined never to be reconciled to him: and that you persist in these sentiments against all the entreaties of his noble relations, against all the prayers and repentance of his ignoble self.\n",
      "Yet have I endeavoured to resign to my hard fate.\n",
      "I even wrote to you that I would sit down contented.\n",
      "I therefore desire not the know more than what common report wounds my ears with; and what is given me to know, by your absence from your cruel family, and from the sacred place, where I, among numbers of your rejected admirers, used to be twice a week sure to behold you doing credit to that service of which your example gave me the highest notions.\n",
      "If I am permitted to indulge a hope, however distant, your silence shall be deemed, by me, the happiest indication of it that you can give—except that still happier—(the happiest than can befall me,) a signification that you will accept the tender of that life and fortune, which it would be my pride and my glory to sacrifice in your service, leaving the reward to yourself.\n",
      "At the time you distinguished me by your favourable opinion, I told you, Sir, that my choice was the single life.\n",
      "You had the generosity to be pleased with the frankness of my behaviour to you; as I had with that of your's to me; and I am sorry, very sorry, to be now told, that the acquaintance you obliged me with gave you so much pain.\n",
      "But this is a subject that cannot be dwelt upon.\n",
      "As to the resolution you solemnly make not to marry while I live, I should be concerned at it, were I not morally sure that you may keep it, and yet not be detrimented by it: since a few, a very few days, will convince you, that I am got above all human dependence; and that there is no need of that protection and favour, which you so generously offer to, Sir,\n",

      "Your obliged well-wisher, and humble servant, CL.\n",
      "Thou must certainly have been let into the secret by this time; and I can tell thee, I shall be plaguy jealous if there is to be any one thing pass between my angel and thee that is to be concealed from me.\n",
      "I begin to be afraid, after all, that this letter was a stratagem to get me out of town, and for nothing else: for, in the first place, Tourville, in a letter I received this morning, tells me, that the lady is actually very ill!\n",
      "[I am sorry for it with all my soul!].\n",
      "My intelligence as to the continuance of her family's implacableness is not to be doubted; and yet when I read her letter, what can one say?—Surely, the dear little rogue will not lie!\n",
      "I never knew her dispense with her word, but once; and that was, when she promised to forgive me after the dreadful fire that had like to have happened at our mother's, and yet would not see me the next day, and afterwards made her escape to Hampstead, in order to avoid forgiving me: and as she severely smarted for this departure from her honour given, (for it is a sad thing for good people to break their word when it is in their power to keep it,) one would not expect that she should set about deceiving again; more especially by the premeditation of writing.\n",
      "Upon my soul, Jack, such is the veneration I have for this admirable woman, that I am shocked barely at putting the case—and so wilt thou, if thou respectest her as thou oughtest: for thou knowest that men and women, all the world over, form their opinions of one another by each person's professions and known practices.\n",
      "And now we shall see you in the way we have so long wished you to be in, cried the other!\n",
      "What I mean by all this is, to let thee see what a stupid figure I shall make to all my own family, if my Clarissa has been capable, as Gulliver in his abominable Yahoo story phrases it, if it were only that I should be outwitted by such a novice at plotting, and that it would make me look silly to my kinswomen here, who know I value myself upon my contrivances, it would vex me to the heart; and I would instantly clap a featherbed into a coach and six, and fetch her away, sick or well, and marry her at my leisure.\n",
      "I presented his sister with the hundred guineas the poor man left me as his executor, and desired her to continue in the house, and take the direction of every thing, till I could hear from his nephew at Antigua, who is heir at law.\n",
      "The poor man left about two hundred pounds in money, and two hundred pounds in two East-India bonds; and I will contrive, if I can, to make up the poor woman's fifty pounds, and my hundred guineas, two hundred pounds to her; and then she will have some little matter coming in certain, which I will oblige her to keep out of the hands of a son, who has completed that ruin which his father had very nearly effected.\n",
      "And so much for poor Belton's affairs till I see you.\n",
      "Mrs. Lovick told me that she had fainted away on Saturday, while she was writing, as she had done likewise the day before; and having received benefit then by a little turn in a chair, she was carried abroad again.\n",
      "It was a cruel thing in me to come amongst honest strangers, and to be sick, and die with you.\n",
      "When they touched upon the irreconcileableness of her friends, I have had ill offices done me to them, said she, and they do not know how ill I am; nor will they believe any thing I should write.\n",
      "He had made a bad spirit take possession of me, I think—broken in upon all my duties —and will not yet, I doubt, let me be at rest.\n",
      "Indeed he is very cruel —but this is one of my trials, I believe.\n",
      "By God's grace, I shall be easier to-morrow, and especially if I have no more of his tormentings, and if I can get a tolerable night.\n",
      "Mrs. Smith told me this with the same surprise and grief that I heard it.\n",
      "She was very ill in the afternoon, having got cold either at St. Dunstan's, or at chapel, and sent for the clergyman to pray by her; and the women, unknown to her, sent both for Dr. H. and Mr. Goddard: who were just gone, as I told you, when I came to pay my respects to her this evening.\n",
      "I long for to-morrow, that I may see her: and yet it is such a melancholy longing as I never experienced, and know not how to describe.\n",
      "I was at Smith's at half an hour after seven.\n",
      "Is it not a little hard upon you, that these troubles should fall so thick to your lot?\n",
      "It will be sometimes better, and sometimes worse, replied she, with poor creatures, when they are balancing between life and death.\n",
      "But no more of these matters just now.\n",
      "I had a very bad spirit upon me.\n",
      "But I hope I shall be no more so.\n",
      "Alas!\n",
      "I believe I looked surprised to hear her confess that her letter was a stratagem only; for she said, You wonder, Mr. Belford, I observe, that I could be guilty of such an artifice.\n",
      "I doubt it is not right: it was done in a hurry of spirits.\n",
      "How could I see a man who had so mortally injured me; yet pretending a sorrow for his crimes, (and wanting to see me,) could behave with so much shocking levity, as he did to the honest people of the house?\n",
      "Yet, 'tis strange too, that neither you nor he found out my meaning on perusal of my letter.\n",
      "'Read but for my father's house, Heaven, said she, and for the interposition of my dear blessed friend, suppose the mediation of my Saviour (which I humbly rely upon); and all the rest of the letter will be accounted for.'\n",
      "But I am afraid it is not strictly right.\n",
      "My surprise being a little over, she proceeded: As to the letter that came from my sister while your friend was here, you will soon see, Sir, that it is the cruellest letter she ever wrote me.\n",
      "I assured her of the most particular attention to this and to all her commands; and that in a manner so agreeable to her, that she invoked a blessing upon me for my goodness, as she called it, to a desolate creature who suffered under the worst of orphanage; those were her words.\n",
      "This gave her a little satisfaction; and then she said that had I not told her that I could promise for you, she was determined, ill as she is, to remove somewhere out of my knowledge as well as out of your's.\n",
      "This thought so wholly possessed me, that I could not help begging, as I went away, her prayers and her blessing, with the reverence due to an angel.\n",
      "In the evening, she was so low and weak, that I took my leave of her in less than a quarter of an hour.\n",
      "She was but just returned from her usual devotions; and Doctor H. alighted as she entered the door.\n",
      "After inquiring how she did, and hearing her complaints of shortness of breath, (which she attributed to inward decay, precipitated by her late harasses, as well from her friends as from you,) he was for advising her to go into the air.\n",
      "The air, Madam, may possibly help the difficulty of breathing, which has so lately attacked you.\n",
      "But, Sir, you see how weak I am.\n",
      "You must see that I have been consuming from day to day; and now, if I can judge by what I feel in myself, putting her hand to her heart, I cannot continue long.\n",
      "But if I were to be at the trouble of removing into new lodgings, (a trouble which I think now would be too much for me,) and this only to die in the country, I had rather the scene were to shut up here.\n",
      "But since you are loth to answer my question directly, I will put it in other words—You don't enjoin me to go into the air, Doctor, do you?\n",
      "Mean time, I repeat my thanks for your goodness to me.—Nay, dear Doctor, hurry not away from me so precipitately [for he was going, for fear of an offered fee]: I will no more affront you with tenders that have pained you for some time past: and since I must now, from this kindly-offered favour, look upon you only as a friend, I will assure you henceforth that I will give you no more uneasiness on that head: and now, Sir, I know I shall have the pleasure of seeing you oftener than heretofore.\n",
      "There are few instances of like disinterestedness, I doubt, in this tribe.\n",
      "Till now I always held it for gospel, that friendship and physician were incompatible things; and little imagined that a man of medicine, when he had given over his patient to death, would think of any visits but those of ceremony, that he might stand well with the family, against it came to their turns to go through his turnpike.\n",
      "She was very curious to know farther particulars of the behaviour of poor Belton in his last moments.\n",
      "You must not wonder at my inquiries, Mr. Belford, said she; For who is it, that is to undertake a journey into a country they never travelled to before, that inquires not into the difficulties of the road, and what accommodations are to be expected in the way?\n",
      "I gave her a brief account of the poor man's terrors, and unwillingness to die: and, when I had done, Thus, Mr. Belford, said she, must it always be with poor souls who have never thought of their long voyage till the moment they are to embark for it.\n",
      "She made other such observations upon this subject as, coming from the mouth of a person who will so soon be a companion for angels, I shall never forget.\n",
      "After some general talk of the times, and of the weather, and such nonsense as Englishmen generally make their introductory topics to conversation, the Colonel addressed himself to Lord M. and to me, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "I need not, my Lord, and Mr. Lovelace, as you know the relation I bear to the Harlowe family, make any apology for entering upon a subject, which, on account of that relation, you must think is the principal reason of the honour I have done myself in this visit.\n",
      "Miss Harlowe, Miss Clarissa Harlowe's affair, said Lord M. with his usual forward bluntness.\n",
      "That, Sir, is what you mean.\n",
      "I know what will be your inference; and have only to say, that time past cannot be recalled; perhaps I wish it could.\n",
      "Nay, I will say still farther, that I am so grossly culpable as to her, that even to plead that the abuses and affronts I daily received from her implacable relations were in any manner a provocation to me to act vilely by her, would be a mean and low attempt to excuse myself—so low and so mean, that it would doubly condemn me.\n",

      "I shall tell you by-and-by, proceeded he, how much she suffers with her friends by false and villanous reports.\n",
      "I then told him, 'That upon this her refusal, I took upon myself to go to town, in hopes to move her in my favour; and that, though I went without giving her notice of my intention, yet had she got some notion of my coming, and so contrived to be out of the way: and at last, when she found I was fully determined at all events to see her, before I went abroad, (which I shall do, said I, if I cannot prevail upon her,) she sent me the letter I have already mentioned to you, desiring me to suspend my purposed visit: and that for a reason which amazes and confounds me; because I don't find there is any thing in it: and yet I never knew her once dispense with her word; for she always made it a maxim, that it was not lawful to do evil, that good might come of it: and yet in this letter, for no reason in the world but to avoid seeing me (to gratify an humour only) has she sent me out of town, depending upon the assurance she had given me.'\n",
      "For, alas!\n",
      "But I cannot forbear saying that I am not a little shocked and surprised, if nothing more be meant by it than to get me into the country without seeing her.\n",
      "the frequent visits of this gentlemen have been interpreted basely to her disreputation.—Read that letter, Mr. Lovelace; and you will be shocked at ever part of it.\n",

      "You cannot but see, said the Colonel, when I had done reading it, that this fellow has been officious in his malevolence; for what he says is mere hearsay, and that hearsay conjectural scandal without fact, or the appearance of fact, to support it; so that an unprejudiced eye, upon the face of the letter, would condemn the writer of it, as I did, and acquit my cousin.\n",

      "One thing I am afraid of; which is, that Miss may be under 'necessities'; and that this Belford (who, as Mrs. Smith owns, hath 'offered her money,' which she, 'at the time,' refused) may find an opportunity to 'take advantage' of those 'necessities': and it is well observed by that poet, that\n",

      "She hesitatingly, seeing me in some emotion, owned that she had some small knowledge of the gentleman.\n",
      "it was but too natural to think, that, where a lady had given way to a delusion, and taken so wrong a step, she would not stop there: that the most sacred places and things were but too often made clokes for bad actions; that Mr.\n",
      "Brand, being unable to account for her admiring my visits, and knowing I was but a new acquaintance of her's, and an old one of Mr. Lovelace, thought himself obliged to lay these matters before her friends.'\n",
      "The two latter, not more by business led to adorn the persons, than generally by scandal to destroy the reputations, of those they have a mind to exercise their talents upon!\n",
      "They answered, that that was not their case; and that they had since inquired into the lady's character and manner of life, and were very much concerned to think any thing they had said should be made use of against her: and as they heard from Mrs. Smith that she was not likely to live long, they should be sorry she should go out of the world a sufferer by their means, or with an ill opinion of them, though strangers to her.\n",
      "That she was a heavenly creature, and fond of taking all occasions to find excuses for her relations on their implacableness to her: that therefore I should take some notice to her of the uncharitable and weak surmises which gave birth to so vile a scandal: but that I would have him, Mr. Walton, (for that is the husband's name,) write to his acquaintance Brand as soon as possible, as he had offered; and so I left them.\n",
      "But I know thee too well to depend upon any thing thou sayest on this subject.\n",
      "Thus didst thou once play off the rough Mowbray with Miss Hatton, till the poor fellow knew not how to go either backward or forward.\n",

      "She was afraid it was not quite right in her.\n",
      "But hoped the end would excuse (if it could not justify) the means.\n",
      "I was under an unnecessary concern, how to break to her that I had the copy of Brand's vile letter: unnecessary, I say; for she took it just as you thought she would, as an excuse she wished to have for the implacableness of her friends; and begged I would let her read it herself; for, said she, the contents cannot disturb me, be they what they will.\n",
      "If the human mind will busy itself to make the worst of every disagreeable occurrence, it will never want woe.\n",
      "But, Madam, said I, you'll see by the date of this letter, that their severity, previous to that, cannot be excused by it.\n",

      "all will be now too late.\n",
      "Mean while, I beg the favour of a few lines, to know if you have reason to doubt Mr. Lovelace's sincerity.\n",
      "I heard with much pleasure that you were come; but I was both afraid and ashamed, till you encouraged me by a first notice, to address myself to you.\n",
      "How consoling is it to my wounded heart to find that you have not been carried away by that tide of resentment and displeasure with which I have been so unhappily overwhelmed—but that, while my still nearer relations have not thought fit to examine into the truth of vile reports raised against me, you have informed yourself of my innocence, and generously credited the information!\n",
      "I have not the least reason to doubt Mr. Lovelace's sincerity in his offers of marriage; nor that all his relations are heartily desirous of ranking me among them.\n",
      "I had given Mr. Lovelace no reason to think me a weak creature.\n",
      "Hitherto he has not had reason to think me weak.\n",

      "This is the superscription [holding it close to her eyes, and rubbing them]; As soon as I am certainly dead, this to be broke open by Mr. Belford.—Here, Sir, I put it [placing it by the will].—These folded papers are letters, and copies of letters, disposed according to their dates.\n",

      "But as you do justice to her virtue, and offer to make her all the reparation now in your power; and as she is so very earnest with him not to resent that usage; and declares, that you could not have been the author of her calamities but through a strange concurrence of unhappy causes; and as he is not at a loss to know how to place to a proper account that strange concurrence; he desires her not to be apprehensive of any vindictive measures from him.'\n",
      "Nevertheless (as may be expected) 'he inveighs against you; as he finds that she gave you no advantage over her.\n",
      "And he is sorry to say, that there are very few young men of fortune but who allow themselves in the same.\n",
      "'If she be so absolutely determined against marrying you, as she declares she is, he hopes, he says, to prevail upon her to take (as soon as her health will permit) a little tour abroad with him, as what will probably establish it; since traveling is certainly the best physic for all those disorders which owe their rise to grief or disappointment.\n",
      "An absence of two or three years will endear her to every one, on her return, and every one to her.\n",
      "Nor will he wait long for that.'\n",

      "If thou knowest, that already I feel the torments of the damned, in the remorse that wrings my heart, on looking back upon my past actions by her, thou wouldst not be the devil thou art, to halloo on a worrying conscience, which, without my merciless aggravations, is altogether intolerable.\n",
      "When the company that used to delight me is as uneasy to me as my reflections are painful, and I can neither help nor divert myself, must not every servant about me partake in a perturbation so sincere!\n",
      "Shall I give thee a faint picture of the horrible uneasiness with which my mind struggles?\n",
      "In order to give him time, I loitered about on the road, riding up this lane to the one highway, down that to the other, just as my horse pointed; all the way cursing my very being; and though so lately looking down upon all the world, wishing to change conditions with the poorest beggar that cried to me for charity as I rode by him—and throwing him money, in hopes to obtain by his prayers the blessing my heart pants after.\n",
      "After I had sauntered about an hour or two, (which seemed three or four tedious ones,) fearing I had slipt the fellow, I inquired at every turnpike, whether a servant in such a livery had not passed through in his return from London, on a full gallop; for woe had been to the dog, had I met him on a sluggish trot!\n",
      "I am now convinced that the wretches who fly from a heavy scene, labour under ten times more distress in the intermediate suspense and apprehension, than they could have, were they present at it, and to see and know the worst: so capable is fancy or imagination, the more immediate offspring of the soul, to outgo fact, let the subject be either joyous or grievous.\n",
      "Woe be to either of the wretches who shall bring me the fatal news that she is no more!\n",
      "For it is but too likely that a shriek-owl so hated will never hoot or scream again; unless the shock, that will probably disorder my whole frame on so sad an occasion, (by unsteadying my hand,) shall divert my aim from his head, heart, or bowels, if it turn not against my own.\n"

      "I could not touch a morsel; and took pen and ink to amuse myself, and oblige you; knowing how impatient you would be for a few lines: for, from what I have recited, you see it was impossible I could withdraw to write when your servant came at half an hour after five, or have an opportunity for it till now; and this is accidental; and yet your poor fellow was afraid to go away with the verbal message I sent; importing, as no doubt he told you, that the Colonel was with us, the lady excessively ill, and that I could not stir to write a line.\n",

      "Belford to Lovelace.— It would be matter of serious reflection to him, he says, if that very Leman, who had been his machine, should be the instrument of his fall.\n",
      "He expects, he says, to find you at Knightsbridge, let him make what haste he can back; and, if he has not a line or two to pacify you, he is afraid you will pistol him; for he apprehends that you are hardly yourself.\n",
      "I therefore dispatch this, and will have another ready, as soon as I can, with particulars.—But you must have a little patience; for how can I withdraw myself every half hour to write, if I am admitted to the lady's presence, or if I am with the Colonel?\n",
      "To be so much exposed to temptation, and to be so liable to fail in the trial, who would not rejoice that all her dangers are over?—All I wished was pardon and blessing from my dear parents.\n",
      "She had fatigued herself so much, (growing sensibly weaker) that she sunk her head upon her pillows, ready to faint; and we withdrew to the window, looking upon one another; but could not tell what to say; and yet both seemed inclinable to speak: but the motion passed over in silence.\n",
      "Our eyes only spoke; and that in a manner neither's were used to—mine, at least, not till I knew this admirable creature.\n"

      "I have your's, with our unhappy friend's enclosed.\n",
      "At my Lord's desire I will write on, and in my common hand; that you may judge what is, and what is not, fit to be read to Mr. Lovelace at present.\n",
      "Thou art a strange impenetrable creature.\n",
      "But let me most earnestly conjure thee, and the idle flutterer, Tourville, from what you have seen of poor Belton's exit; from our friend Lovelace's phrensy, and the occasion of it; and from the terrible condition in which the wretched Sinclair lies; to set about an immediate change of life and manners.\n",
      "I have a scene to paint in relation to the wretched Sinclair, that, if I do it justice, will make thee seriously ponder and reflect, or nothing can.\n",
      "From whom should this visit be, but from Sally Martin, accompanied by Mrs. Carter, the sister of the infamous Sinclair!\n",
      "I was very loth to be diverted from my purpose by a request so unwelcome, and from people so abhorred; but at last went, and we got thither by ten; where a scene so shocking presented itself to me, that the death of poor desponding Belton is not, I think, to be compared with it.\n",
      "The old wretch had once put her leg out by her rage and violence, and had been crying, scolding, cursing, ever since the preceding evening, that the surgeon had told her it was impossible to save her; and that a mortification had begun to show itself; insomuch that, purely in compassion to their own ears, they had been forced to send for another surgeon, purposely to tell her, though against his judgment, and (being a friend of the other) to seem to convince him, that he mistook the case; and that if she would be patient, she might recover.\n",
      "There were no less than eight of her cursed daughters surrounding her bed when I entered; one of her partners, Polly Horton, at their head; and now Sally, her other partner, and Madam Carter, as they called her, (for they are all Madams with one another,) made the number ten; all in shocking dishabille, and without stays, except Sally, Carter, and Polly; who, not daring to leave her, had not been in bed all night.\n",
      "The other seven seemed to have been but just up, risen perhaps from their customers in the fore-house, and their nocturnal orgies, with faces, three or four of them, that had run, the paint lying in streaky seams not half blowzed off, discovering coarse wrinkled skins: the hair of some of them of divers colours, obliged to the black-lead comb where black was affected; the artificial jet, however, yielding apace to the natural brindle: that of others plastered with oil and powder; the oil predominating: but every one's hanging about her ears and neck in broken curls, or ragged ends; and each at my entrance taken with one motion, stroking their matted locks with both hands under their coifs, mobs, or pinners, every one of which was awry.\n",
      "They were all slip-shoed; stockingless some; only under-petticoated all; their gowns, made to cover straddling hoops, hanging trollopy, and tangling about their heels; but hastily wrapt round them, as soon as I came up stairs.\n",
      "And half of them (unpadded, shoulder-bent, pallid-lips, limber-jointed wretches) appearing, from a blooming nineteen or twenty perhaps over-night, haggard well-worn strumpets of thirty-eight or forty.\n",
      "If thou hadst, I believe thou wouldst hate a profligate woman, as one of Swift's yahoos, or Virgil's obscene harpies, squirting their ordure upon the Trojan trenches; since the persons of such in their retirements are as filthy as their minds.— Hate them as much as I do; and as much as I admire, and next to adore, a truly virtuous and elegant woman: for to me it is evident, that as a neat and clean woman must be an angel of a creature, so a sluttish one is the impurest animal in nature.\n",
      "But to let me tumble down stairs so distant from the room I went from!\n",
      "so distant from the room I meant to go to!—Cursed, cursed be every careless devil!—May this or worse be their fate every one of them!\n",
      "No time to repent!—And in a few hours (Oh!—Oh!—with another long howling O—h!—U—gh—o!\n",
      "she, it seems, is dead and gone!\n",
      "And is she dead?—Indeed dead?\n",
      "proceeded she, when her howl was over—O what an angel have I been the means of destroying!\n",
      "I said, that if her time were to be so short as she apprehended, the more ought she to endeavour to compose herself: and then she would at least die with more ease to herself—and satisfaction to her friends, I was going to say—But the word die put her into a violent raving, and thus she broke in upon me.\n",
      "And then, but that half a dozen at once endeavoured to keep down her violent hands, would she have beaten herself; as it seems she had often attempted to do from the time the surgeon popt out the word mortification to her.\n",
      "You should let her know the worst, and then she must submit; for there is no running away from death.\n",
      "A few days added to her life may be of service to her in both respects.\n",
      "And so the poor wretch was to be lanced and quartered, as I may say, for an experiment only!\n",
      "I cannot but say I have a mean opinion of both these gentlemen, who, though they make a figure, it seems, in their way of living, and boast not only French extraction, but a Paris education, never will make any in their practice.\n",
      "As nobody cared to tell the unhappy wretch what every one apprehended must follow, and what the surgeons convinced me soon would, I undertook to be the denouncer of her doom.\n",
      "I hardly know what I wanted with you.\n",
      "repeating those words five or six times, spare thy poor creature, and every hour of my life shall be passed in penitence and atonement: upon my soul it shall!\n",
      "Less vehement!\n",
      "a little less vehement!\n",
      "Then did the poor wretch set up an inarticulate frightful howl, such a one as I never before heard of her; and seeing every one half-frighted, and me motioning to withdraw, O pity me, pity me, Mr. Belford, cried she, her words interrupted by groans—I find you think I shall die!—And what may I be, and where, in a very few hours—who can tell?\n",
      "I was going to re-advise her to calm her spirits, and endeavour to resign herself, and to make the beset of the opportunity yet left her; but this declaration set her into a most outrageous raving.\n",
      "Nor is it to be wondered at, when it is considered that, to the various ill smells that will always be found in a close sick bed-room, (for generally, when the physician comes, the air is shut out,) this of Mrs. Sinclair was the more particularly offensive, as, to the scent of plasters, salves, and ointments, were added the stenches of spirituous liquors, burnt and unburnt, of all denominations; for one or other of the creatures, under pretence of colics, gripes, or qualms, were continually calling for supplies of these, all the time I was there.\n",
      "What woman, nice in her person, and of purity in her mind and manners, did she know what miry wallowers the generality of men of our class are in themselves, and constantly trough and sty with, but would detest the thoughts of associating with such filthy sensualists, whose favourite taste carries them to mingle with the dregs of stews, brothels, and common sewers?\n",
      "Don't be disgusted, that I mingle such grave reflections as these with my narratives.\n",
      "It becomes me, in my present way of thinking, to do so, when I see, in Miss Harlowe, how all human excellence, and in poor Belton, how all inhuman libertinism, and am near seeing in this abandoned woman, how all diabolical profligacy, end.\n",
      "I came home reflecting upon all these things, more edifying to me than any sermon I could have heard preached: and I shall conclude this long letter with observing, that although I left the wretched howler in a high phrensy-fit, which was excessively shocking to the by-standers; yet her phrensy must be the happiest part of her dreadful condition: for when she is herself, as it is called, what must be her reflections upon her past profligate life, throughout which it has been her constant delight and business, devil-like, to make others as wicked as herself!\n",
      "on looking forward to the dreadful state she is now upon the verge of!—But I drop my trembling pen.\n",
      "To have done with so shocking a subject at once, we shall take notice,\n",
      "      that Mr. Belford, in a future letter, writes, that the miserable\n",
      "      woman, to the surprise of the operators themselves, (through hourly\n",

      "      a transitory penitence all the wretches about her.\n",
      "Poor Mrs. Norton was so very ill upon the road, that, slowly as the hearse moved, and the chariot followed, I was afraid we should not have got her to St. Albans.\n",
      "I was in hopes that she would have been better for the stop: but I was forced to leave her behind me.\n",
      "They all helped on one another's grief, as they had before done each other's hardness of heart.\n",
      "My cousin Arabella came to me full of tears and grief.\n",
      "I myself was full of grief; and, without going farther or speaking, sat down in the hall in the first chair.\n",
      "The brother sat on one hand of me, the sister on the other.\n",
      "The poor mother, bowing her head to me in speechless grief, sat with her handkerchief held to her eyes with one hand.\n",
      "The other hand was held by her sister Hervey, between both her's; Mrs. Hervey weeping upon it.\n",
      "But she was unable to utter them, and got behind her mother's chair; and, inclining her face over it, on the unhappy lady's shoulder, seemed to claim the consolation that indulgent parent used, but then was unable, to afford her.\n",
      "that thy gentle spirit, breathing charity and forgiveness to the vilest of men, shall avail him!—But once more I stop —forgive me, Sir!—Who could behold such a scene, who could recollect it in order to describe it, (as minutely as you wished me to relate how this unhappy family were affected on this sad occasion,) every one of the mourners nearly related to himself, and not to be exasperated against the author of all?\n",
      "As I was the only person (grieved as I was myself) from whom any of them, at that instant, could derive comfort; Let us not, said I, my dear Cousin, approaching the inconsolable mother, give way to a grief, which, however just, can now avail us nothing.\n",
      "cried the unhappy mother, withdrawing her hand from that of her sister Hervey, and pressing mine with it, you know not what a child I have lost!—Then in a low voice, and how lost!—That it is that makes the loss insupportable.\n",
      "We must for every be disturbed for those acts of unkindness to so sweet a child, cried the unhappy mother!—Indeed!\n",
      "Would to Heaven, proceeded, exclaiming, the poor mother, I had but once seen her!\n",
      "if WE were to receive as little mercy—And there again she stopt, her tears interrupting her farther speech; every one, all the time, remaining silent; their countenances showing a grief in their hearts too big for expression.\n",
      "Now you see, Mr. Belford, that my dearest cousin could be allowed all her merit!—What a dreadful thing is after-reflection upon a conduct so perverse and unnatural?\n",
      "I will lay down my pen till I have recovered my temper.\n",
      "A servant came in to acquaint us with what its lumbering heavy noise up the paved inner court-yard apprized us of before.\n",
      "And with reason: she was the common patroness of all the honest poor in her neighbourhood.\n",
      "It is natural for us, in every deep and sincere grief, to interest all we know in what is so concerning to ourselves.\n",
      "A hearse, passing through country villages, and from London, however slenderly attended, (for the chariot, as I have said, waited upon poor Mrs. Norton,) takes every one's attention.\n",
      "The presence of their young master possibly might awe them, and cause their grief to be expressed only in dumb show.\n",
      "Their sorrow was heightened, no doubt, by the remembrance of their unforgiving severity: and now seeing before them the receptacle that contained the glory of their family, who so lately was driven thence by their indiscreet violence; never, never more to be restored to the!\n",
      "no wonder that their grief was more than common grief.\n",
      "The poor lady but just cast her eye upon the coffin, and then snatched it away, retiring with passionate grief towards the window; yet, addressing herself, with clasped hands, as if to her beloved daughter: O my Child, my Child!\n",
      "Why was I not permitted to speak pardon and peace to thee!—O forgive thy cruel mother!\n",
      "His grief was too deep for utterance, till he saw his son coming in; and then, fetching a heavy groan, Never, said he, was sorrow like my sorrow!\n"

      "THE WILL\n",
      "\n",
      "To which the following preamble, written on a separate paper, was Stitched in black silk.\n",
      "Hence have I, for some time past, employed myself in penning down heads of such a disposition; which, as reasons offered, I have altered and added to, so that I was never absolutely destitute of a will, had I been taken off ever so suddenly.\n",
      "But as I have, by one very unhappy step, been thought to disgrace my whole lineage, and therefore this last honour may be refused to my corpse; in this case my desire is, that it may be interred in the churchyard belonging to the parish in which I shall die; and that in the most private manner, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night; attended only by Mrs. Lovick, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and their maid servant.\n",
      "I have already given verbal directions, that, after I am dead, (and laid out in the manner I have ordered,) I may be put into my coffin as soon as possible: it is my desire, that I may not be unnecessarily exposed to the view of any body; except any of my relations should vouchsafe, for the last time, to look upon me.\n",
      "And I could wish, if it might be avoided without making ill will between Mr. Lovelace and my executor, that the former might not be permitted to see my corpse.\n",
      "Let him behold, and triumph over the wretched remains of one who has been made a victim to his barbarous perfidy: but let some good person, as by my desire, give him a paper, whist he is viewing the ghastly spectacle, containing these few words only,—'Gay, cruel heart!\n",
      "The subject of the discourse I shall determine before I conclude this writing.\n",
      "So much written about what deserves not the least consideration, and\n",
      "      about what will be nothing when this writing comes to be opened\n",
      "      and read, will be excused, when my present unhappy circumstances\n",
      "      and absence from all my natural friends are considered.\n",
      "To Mrs. Dorothy Hervey, the only sister of my honoured mother, I bequeath the sum of fifty guineas for a ring; and I beg of her to accept of my thankful acknowledgements for all her goodness to me from my infancy; and particularly for her patience with me, in the several altercations that happened between my brother and sister and me, before my unhappy departure from Harlowe-place.\n",
      "I desire my humble and grateful thanks may be given to him for his favours and goodness to me; and particularly for his endeavours to reconcile my other friends to me, at a time when I was doubtful whether he would forgive me himself.\n",
      "H. with my hair in crystal, and round the inside of each, the day, month, and year of my death: each ring, with brilliants, to cost twenty guineas.\n",
      "In the middle drawer of my escritoire, at Harlowe-place, are many letters, and copies of letters, put up according to their dates, which I have written or received in a course of years (ever since I learned to write) from and to my grandfather, my father and mother, my uncles, my brother and sister, on occasional little absences; my late uncle Morden, my cousin Morden; Mrs. Norton, and Miss Howe, and other of my companions and friends, before my confinement at my father's: as also from the three reverent gentlemen, Dr. Blome, Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Tomkins, now with God, and the very reverend Dr. Lewen, on serious subjects.\n",
      "the sole executor of this my last will and testament; having previously obtained his leave so to do.\n",
      "I have given the reasons which induced me to ask this gentleman to take upon him this trouble to Miss Howe.\n",
      "I therefore refer to her on this subject.\n",
      "Having been pressed by Miss Howe and her mother to collect the particulars of my sad story, and given expectation that I would, in order to do my character justice with all my friends and companions; but not having time before me for the painful task; it has been a pleasure for me to find, by extracts kindly communicated to me by my said executor, that I may safely trust my fame to the justice done me by Mr. Lovelace, in his letters to him my said executor.\n",
      "His very moderate bill I have discharged down to yesterday.\n",
      "I have always thought it incumbent upon testators to shorten all they can the trouble of their executors.\n",
      "It has always been a rule with me, in my little donations, to endeavour to aid and set forward the sober and industrious poor.\n",
      "In the beginning of this tedious writing, I referred to the latter part of it, the naming of the subject of the discourse which I wished might be delivered at my funeral, if permitted to be interred with my ancestors.\n",
      "But if I am to be interred in town, let only the usual burial-service be read over my corpse.\n",
      "If my body be permitted to be carried down, I bequeath ten pounds to be given to the poor of the parish, at the discretion of the church-wardens, within a fortnight after my interment.\n",
      "The unhappy mother and Mrs. Norton chose to be absent on the affecting occasion.\n",
      "They were all extremely touched with the preamble.\n",
      "Mrs. Hervey and Miss Arabella sobbed; the uncles wiped their eyes; the brother looked down; the father wrung his hands.\n",
      "Some other passages in the will were called flights, and such whimsies as distinguish people of imagination from those of judgment.\n",
      "Miss Harlowe said, That as she and her sister never bought the same books, she would take that to herself, and would make it up to her cousin Dolly one way or other.\n",
      "I intend, Mr. Belford, to save you the trouble of interposing—the library shall be my cousin Dolly's.\n",
      "Mrs. Hervey could hardly keep her seat.\n",
      "But, at another time, she declared, with tears, that she could not forgive herself for a letter she wrote,* looking at Miss Arabella, whom, it seems, unknown to any body, she had consulted before she wrote it and which, she said, must have wounded a spirit, that now she saw had been too deeply wounded before.\n",
      "O my Aunt, said Arabella, no more of that!—Who would have thought that the dear creature had been such a penitent?\n",
      "Indeed, the mutual upbraidings and grief of all present, upon those articles in which every one was remembered for good, so often interrupted me, that the reading took up above six hours.\n",
      "Yet to what purpose did they regret the pecuniary bequests, when the poor's fund, and not themselves, would have had the benefit, had not those legacies been bequeathed?\n",
      "Had she chosen one in it, I dare say that her will would have been no more regarded than if it had been the will of a dead king; than that of Louis XIV.\n",
      "in particular; so flagrantly broken through by his nephew the Duke of Orleans before he was cold.\n",
      "A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow shall not be my heir.\n",
      "I would, therefore, humbly propose that your Lordship, and his other relations, will forward the purpose your kinsman lately had to go abroad; where I hope he will stay till all is blown over.\n",
      "We are all extremely affected with the dear lady's death.\n",
      "They will be long, long worn in memory of the dear testatrix.\n",
      "Every body is assured that you will do all in your power to prevent farther ill consequences from this melancholy affair.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is, however, necessary to observe, on this subject, that the unhappy mother, being supported by the two uncles, influenced the afflicted father to over-rule all his son's objections, and to direct a literal observation of the will; and at the same time to give up all the sums which he was empowered by it to reimburse himself; as also to take upon himself to defray the funeral expenses.\n",
      "It is that which relates to the interview between yourself and Mr. Lovelace, at Mr. Dormer's,* in which Mr. Lovelace treats you with an air of levity, which neither your person, your character, nor your commission, deserved; but which was his usual way of treating every one whose business he was not pleased with.\n",
      "I hope, Sir, you have too much greatness of mind to be disturbed at the contents of this letter, should Miss Howe communicate them to you; and the rather, as it is impossible that you should suffer with her on that account.'\n",
      "I argue to myself, in all such cases as this, as Miss Howe, from her ever-dear friend, argues, That if the reflections thrown upon me are just, I ought not only to forgive them, but endeavour to profit by them; if unjust, that I ought to despise them, and the reflector too, since it would be inexcusable to strengthen by anger an enemy whose malice might be disarmed by contempt.\n",
      "And, moreover, I should be almost sorry to find myself spoken well of by a man who could treat, as he treated, a lady who was an ornament to her sex and to human nature.\n",
      "He had mentioned, with compassion, the distresses of the Harlowe family— 'Persons of a pitiful nature, says she, may pity them.\n",
      "You, I think, pity the infernal man likewise; while I, from my heart, grudge him his phrensy, because it deprives him of that remorse, which, I hope, in his recovery, will never leave him.\n",
      "At times, Sir, let me tell you, that I hate your whole sex for his sake; even men of unblamable characters, whom, at those times, I cannot but look upon as persons I have not yet found out.\n",
      "He acquaints her that the family had given Colonel Morden the keys of all that belonged to the dear departed; that the unhappy mother had (as the will allows) ordered a piece of needlework to be set aside for her, and had desired Mrs. Norton to get the little book of meditations transcribed, and to let her have the original, as it was all of her dear daughter's hand-writing; and as it might, when she could bear to look into it, administer consolation to herself.\n",
      "My doom is unalterably fixed; and I am either a miserable or happy being to all eternity.\n",
      "If happy, I owe it solely to the Divine mercy; if miserable, to your undeserved cruelty.—And consider not, for your own sake, gay, cruel, fluttering, unhappy man!\n",
      "When once a dangerous sickness seizes you; when once effectual remorse breaks in upon you; how dreadful will be your condition!\n",
      "They are wholly as disinterested as undeserved.\n",
      "But I should mistrust my own penitence, were I capable of wishing to recompense evil for evil—if, black as your offences have been against me, I could not forgive, as I wish to be forgiven.\n"

      "When I have the pleasure of seeing you next, I will acquaint you, Sir, with all the circumstances of this melancholy story; from which you will see that Mr. Lovelace was extremely ill treated at first, by the whole family, this admirable lady excepted.\n",
      "This exception, I know, heightens his crime: but as his principal intention was but to try her virtue; and that he became so earnest a suppliant to her for marriage; and as he has suffered so deplorably in the loss of his reason, for not having it in his power to repair her wrongs; I presume to hope that much is to be pleaded against such a resolution as you are said to have made.\n",
      "I will read to you, at the same time, some passages from letters of his; two of which (one but this moment received) will convince you that the unhappy man, who is but now recovering his intellects, needs no greater punishment than what he has from his own reflections.\n",
      "Such, at least, is the effect they have upon me, that I hope I shall never be provoked to draw my sword again in a private quarrel.\n",
      "To the weight these must needs have upon you, let me add, that the unhappy man has given no new occasion of offence, since your visit to him at Lord M.'s, when you were so well satisfied of his intention to atone for his crimes, that you yourself urged to your dear cousin her forgiveness of him.\n",
      "Excuse me, Sir, for the sake of my executorial duty and promise, keeping in eye the dear lady's personal injunctions, as well as written will, enforced by letters posthumous.\n",
      "One principal end of my writing to you, in this solemn manner, is, to beg of you, which I do with the utmost earnestness, that when you come to hear the particulars of my story, you will not suffer active resentment to take place in your generous breast on my account.\n",
      "'Tis an attempt to take away a life that ought not to depend upon a private sword; an act, the consequence of which is to hurry a soul (all its sins upon its had) into perdition; endangering that of the poor triumpher— since neither intend to give to the other that chance, as I may call it, for the Divine mercy, in an opportunity for repentance, which each presumes to hope for himself.\n",
      "Give not the unhappy man the merit (were you assuredly to be the victor) of falling by your hand.\n",
      "At present he is the perfidious, the ungrateful deceiver; but will not the forfeiture of his life, and the probable loss of his soul, be a dreadful expiation for having made me miserable for a few months only, and through that misery, by the Divine favour, happy to all eternity?\n",
      "In such a case, my Cousin, where shall the evil stop?—And who shall avenge on you?—And who on your avenger?\n",
      "Let the poor man's conscience, then, dear Sir, avenge me.\n",
      "If the Almighty will give him time for it, who should you deny it him?—Let him still be the guilty aggressor; and let no one say, Clarissa Harlowe is now amply revenged in his fall; or, in the case of your's, (which Heaven avert!)\n",
      "Often, Sir, has the more guilty been the vanquisher of the less.\n",
      "Nor can it be thought an unequal dispensation, were it generally to happen that the usurper of the Divine prerogative should be punished for his presumption by the man whom he sought to destroy, and who, however previously criminal, is put, in this case, upon a necessary act of self-defence.\n",
      "Be a comforter, dear Sir, to my honoured parents, as you have been to me; and may we, through the Divine goodness to us both, meet in that blessed eternity, into which, as I humbly trust, I shall have entered when you will read this.\n",
      "DEAR SIR,\n",

      "I am very sorry that any thing you have heard I have said should give you uneasiness.\n",
      "Were she a man, do you think, Sir, she, at this time, would have your advice to take upon such a subject as that upon which you write?\n",
      "No good man but must be influenced by them.—But, alas!\n",
      "Sir, was it not enough\n",

      "But after all, I see that there is something so charmingly brilliant and frank in Miss Howe's disposition, although at present visibly overclouded by grief, that it is impossible not to love her, even for her failings.\n",
      "And if she does, she will have additional merit with me; since she cannot be apprehensive of check or controul; and may therefore, by her generosity and prudence, lay an obligation upon her husband, by the performance of what is no more than her duty.\n",
      "But, alas!\n",
      "I took the liberty upon it to tell Miss Howe that I hoped that her part of a will, so soon, and so punctually, in almost all its other articles, fulfilled, would not be the only one that would be slighted.\n",
      "Her mother had the words of the will on her side; and Mr. Hickman's interest in her view; her daughter having said that she would wear it for six months at least.\n",

      "You will excuse me, Mr. Belford, for the particularities which you invited and encouraged.\n",

      "As to myself, the little part I had taken in the gaiety kept me unconcerned.\n",
      "But after that hour, and when we thought of parting, he became a little more serious: and then he told me his designs, and gave me a plan of his intended tour; wishing heartily that I could have accompanied him.\n",
      "He would see me once again, he said; and it would be upon very ill terms if I complied not with his request.\n",
      "But, at last, all was made up, and he offered to forget and forgive every thing, on condition that I would correspond with him while abroad, and continue the series which had been broken through by his illness; and particularly give him, as I had offered, a copy of the lady's last will.\n",
      "But thy these wamblings in thy cursed gizzard, and thy awkward grimaces, I see thou'rt but a novice in it yet!—Ah, Belford, Belford, thou hast a confounded parcel of briers and thorns to trample over barefoot, before religion will illuminate these gloomy features!'\n",
      "Mowbray gave his opinion, that he ought to leave it like a man of honour as he was; and if he did not take those gentlemen to task for their opprobrious speeches, that at least he should be seen by them in public before he went away; else they might give themselves airs, as if he had left the kingdom in fear of them.\n",
      "To this he himself so much inclined, that it was with difficulty I persuaded him, that, as they had neither of them proceeded to a direct and formal challenge; as they knew he had not made himself difficult of access; and as he had already done the family injury enough; and it was Miss Harlowe's earnest desire, that he would be content with that; he had no reason, from any point of honour, to delay his journey; especially as he had so just a motive for his going, as the establishing of his health; and as he might return the sooner, if he saw occasion for it.\n",
      "He has some accounts to settle with his banker; which, he says, will be adjusted to-morrow; and on Thursday he proposes to go down again, to take leave of his friends; and then intends to set out directly for Italy.\n",
      "I wish Mr. Lovelace could have been prevailed upon to take any other tour, than that of France and Italy.\n",
      "But my intention is to go to Florence; and not to lay my bones there, as upon my cousin's death I told you I thought to do; but to settle all my affairs in those parts, and then to come over, and reside upon a little paternal estate in Kent, which is strangely gone to ruin in my absence.\n",

      "'As for me, I never will, I never can, marry—that I will not take a few liberties, and that I will not try to start some of my former game, I won't promise—habits are not so easily shaken off—but they shall be by way of wearing.\n",

      "Very few persons, she used to say, would be condemned, or even accused, in the circles of ladies, were they present; it is generous, therefore, nay, it is but just, said she, to take the part of the absent, if not flagrantly culpable.\n",
      "An instance of what I mean occurs to my memory.\n",
      "But although human depravity may, I doubt, oftener justify those who judge harshly, than human rectitude can those who judge favourably, yet will I not part with my charity.\n",
      "And that the offering at an excuse in a blameable manner, was the undoubted mark of a disingenuous, if not of a perverse mind.'\n",
      "You must every where insist upon it, that had it not been for the stupid persecutions of her relations, she never would have been in the power of that horrid Lovelace.\n",

      "And yet I was entirely of her opinion, that those women, who were solicitous to obtain that knowledge of learning which they supposed would add to their significance in sensible company, and in their attainment of it imagined themselves above all domestic usefulness, deservedly incurred the contempt which they hardly ever failed to meet with.\n",

      "\n",
      "The news of Mr. LOVELACE's unhappy end was received with as much grief by his own relations, as it was with exultation by the Harlowe family, and by Miss Howe.\n",
      "The unhappy parents and uncles, from the perusal of these extracts, too evidently for their peace, saw that it was entirely owing to the avarice, the ambition, the envy, of her implacable brother and sister, and to the senseless confederacy entered into by the whole family, to compel her to give her hand to a man she must despise, or she had not been a CLARISSA, and to their consequent persecution of her, that she ever thought of quitting her father's house: and that even when she first entertained such a thought, it was with intent, if possible, to procure for herself a private asylum with Mrs. Howe, or at some other place of safety, (but not with Mr. Lovelace, nor with any of the ladies of his family, though invited by the latter,) from whence she might propose terms which ought to have been complied with, and which were entirely consistent with her duty—that though she found herself disappointed of the hoped-for refuge and protection, she intended not, by meeting Mr. Lovelace, to put herself into his power; all that she aimed at by taking that step being to endeavour to pacify so fierce a spirit, lest he should (as he indeed was determined to do) pay a visit to her friends, which might have been attended with fatal consequences; but was spirited away by him in such a manner, as made her an object of pity rather than of blame.\n",
      "How did they recriminate upon each other!\n",
      "These intelligences and recollections were perpetual subjects of recrimination to them: heightened their anguish for the loss of a child who was the glory of their family; and not seldom made them shun each other, (at the times they were accustomed to meet together,) that they might avoid the mutual reproaches of eyes that spoke, when tongues were silent—their stings also sharpened by time!\n",
      "What an unhappy family was this!\n",
      "Well might Colonel Morden, in the words of Juvenal, challenge all other miserable families to produce such a growing distress as that of the Harlowes (a few months before so happy!)\n",
      "Mrs. HARLOWE lived about two years and an half after the lamented death of her CLARISSA.\n",
      "He attributes all his misfortunes, when he opens himself to the few friends he has, to his vile and cruel treatment of his angelic sister.\n",

      "      THE MOST MISERABLE OF BEINGS.\n",
      "Brothers and sisters, when they are not friends, are generally the sharpest enemies to each other.\n",
      "And for some years past, they have so heartily hated each other, that if either know a joy, it is in being told of some new misfortune or displeasure that happens to the other.\n",
      "Especially as she regrets to this hour, and declares that she shall to the last of her life, her cruel treatment of that sister; and (as well as her brother) is but too ready to attribute to that her own unhappiness.\n",
      "As those sisters in iniquity, SALLY MARTIN and POLLY HORTON, had abilities and education superior to what creatures of their cast generally can boast of; and as their histories are no where given in the preceding papers, in which they are frequently mentioned; it cannot fail of gratifying the reader's curiosity, as well as answering the good ends designed by the publication of this work, to give a brief account of their parentage, and manner of training-up, preparative to the vile courses they fell into, and of what became of them, after the dreadful exit of the infamous Sinclair.\n",
      "Late hours (turning night into day, and day into night) were the almost unavoidable consequences of her frequent play.\n",
      "The needle she hated: and made the constant subjects of her ridicule the fine works that used to employ, and keep out of idleness, luxury, and extravagance, and at home (were they to have been of no other service) the women of the last age, when there were no Vauxhalls, Ranelaghs, Marybones, and such-like places of diversion, to dress out for, and gad after.\n",
      "They flattered themselves, and they flattered their girl, and she was entirely of their opinion, that she had charms and wit enough to attract some man of rank; of fortune at least: and yet this daughter of a mercer-father and grocer-mother could not bear the thoughts of a creeping cit; encouraging herself with the few instances (common ones, of girls much inferior to herself in station, talents, education, and even fortune, who had succeeded—as she doubted not to succeed).\n",
      "But whatever it might be to Sally, it was no disappointment to Mr. Lovelace, to find his mistress of no higher degree; because he hoped to reduce her soon to the lowest condition that an unhappy woman can fall into.\n",
      "He found it not difficult to induce her to proceed in the guilty commerce, till the effects of it became to apparent to be hid.\n",

      "Her father dying, her mother, in hopes to reclaim her, as she called it, proposed her to quit the house of the infamous Sinclair, and to retire with her into the country, where her disgrace, and her then wicked way of life, would not be known; and there so to live as to save appearances; the only virtue she had ever taught her; besides that of endeavouring rather to delude than be deluded.\n",
      "This unnatural wickedness, in half a year's time, she brought about; and then the serpent retired to her obscene den with her spoils, laughing at what she had done; even after it had broken her mother's heart, as it did in a few months' time: a severe, but just punishment for the unprincipled education she had given her.\n",
      "And it is certain that this, and other instances of her complicated wickedness, turned early Lovelace's heart against her; and, had she not been subservient to him in his other pursuits, he would not have endured her: for, speaking of her, he would say, Let not any one reproach us, Jack: there is no wickedness like the wickedness of a woman.\n",

      "The widow herself, half intoxicated, and raised as she was with artful mixtures, and inflamed by love, unexpectedly tendered by one of the libertines, his constant companions, (to whom an opportunity was contrived to be given to be alone with her, and that closely followed by importunity), fell into her daughter's error.\n",

      "And as Mr. Belford had been blessed with a son by her, his Lordship at his death [which happened just three years after the untimely one of his unhappy nephew] was pleased to devise to that son, and to his descendents for ever (and in case of his death unmarried, to any other children of his niece) his Hertfordshire estate, (designed for Mr. Lovelace,) which he made up to the value of a moiety of his real estates; bequeathing also a moiety of his personal to the same lady.\n",

      "This was not the way, as it proved, to be taken for matters of mere omission, with a man of Mr. Lovelace's penetration.\n",
      "Their behaviour to him, when they could not help seeing him, was very cold and disobliging; but as yet not directly affrontive.\n",
      "But when Mr. Lovelace was told how ill I was, he departed; nevertheless vowing revenge.\n",
      "And indeed my aunt Hervey has put it to my mother, whether it were not best to prevail upon my brother to take a turn to his Yorkshire estate (which he was intending to do before) and to stay there till all is blown over.\n",
      "But I am angry with him myself, and cannot help it.\n",
      "Alas!\n",

      "I know my duty, said I; and hope I shall not find impossible condition annexed to it.\n",
      "How do needless watchfulness and undue restraint produce artifice and contrivance!\n",
      "You are your mother's girl, think what you will; and have violent spirits to contend with.\n",
      "Alas!\n",
      "I indulged this surmise against rumour, because I could not believe that the absurdest people in England could be so very absurd as to think of this man for you.\n",
      "Don't be angry.\n",
      "He is indeed himself, as I may say, that secret!\n",
      "My brother then returned; and we were all wrong again: and Bella, as I observed in my letters abovementioned, had an opportunity to give herself the credit of having refused Mr. Lovelace, on the score of his reputed faulty morals.\n",
      "An unhappy tenant of my uncle Antony came petitioning to my uncle for forbearance, in Mr. Lovelace's presence.\n",
      "They do indeed value her: but, I am sorry to say, she has purchased that value by her compliances; yet has merit for which she ought to be venerated; prudence which ought of itself to be conformed to in every thing.\n",
      "It is very unhappy, my dear, since your friends will have you marry, that a person of your merit should be addressed by a succession of worthless creatures, who have nothing but their presumption for their excuse.\n",

      "She was very angry, and seemed to be greatly disappointed.\n",
      "Would to heaven, the man so hated had not the pretence to make of having been too violently treated, when he meant peace and reconciliation!\n",

      "Would you have me, Madam, make him desperate?\n",
      "I believe it was a quarter of an hour before she spoke to me (my heart throbbing with the suspense all the time); and then she asked me coldly, What directions I had given for the day?\n",
      "She made a small alteration in it; but with an air so cold and so solemn, as added to my emotions.\n",
      "She seemed struck; but was to be angry with me.\n",
      "She never tells the story of their parting, and of her refusal of him, but her colour rises, she looks with disdain upon me, and mingles anger with the airs she gives herself:—anger as well as airs, demonstrating, that she refused a man whom she thought worth accepting: Where else is the reason either for anger or boast?—Poor Bella!\n",
      "You are sullen, Clarissa: I see you are sullen.—And she walked about the room in anger.\n",

      "If he has not inquired, I shall be very angry with him.\n",
      "But yet, permit me to say, that he is not quite so horrible a creature as you make him: as to his person, I mean; for with regard to his mind, by all I have heard, you have done him but justice: but you have such a talent at an ugly likeness, and such a vivacity, that they sometimes carry you out of verisimilitude.\n",
      "I am sorry my case is so circumstanced, that I cannot comply.\n",
      "I am truly sorry to have cause to say, that I have heard it often remarked, that your uncontrouled passions are not a credit to your liberal education.\n",
      "It shall, I assure you, if I can make it so, so long as you prefer that villainous Lovelace, (who is justly hated by all your family) to every body.\n",
      "that's the pretence; but Sister, Sister, let me tell you, that is because Lovelace has got into your fond heart:—a wretch hated, justly hated, by us all; and who has dipped his hands in the blood of your brother: yet him you would make our relation, would you?\n",
      "Some people may indeed be afraid, that if they did not assume, they would be trampled upon.\n",
      "She would not, I believe, have hated him, had she not been bid to hate him: and had it not been for the rencounter between him and her only son.\n",
      "They are angry also, as I understand, with my mother, for returning his compliment.\n",
      "I have no notion of playing the hypocrite so egregiously, as to pretend to be blind to qualifications which every one sees and acknowledges.\n",
      "And with REVENGE it shall glow!—For, dost thou think, that if it were not from the hope, that this stupid family are all combined to do my work for me, I would bear their insults?—Is it possible to imagine, that I would be braved as I am braved, threatened as I am threatened, by those who are afraid to see me; and by this brutal brother, too, to whom I gave a life; [a life, indeed, not worth my taking!]\n",

      "How miserable the life, if it can be called life!\n",

      "I think myself very unhappy in having incurred your displeasure.\n",
      "how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one, and then of the other, rattle through the court-yard, and the hollow-sounding foot-step giving notice of each person's stepping out, to take his place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges!\n",

      "O how the poor Bella raved!\n",
      "I thought she would have beat me once or twice: and she vowed her fingers itched to do so—but I was not worth her anger: yet she flamed on.\n",

      "Don't you, dear Madam, said I, put questions that can answer no end, but to support my brother's schemes against me.—But are there any hopes of an end to my sufferings and disgrace, without having this hated man imposed upon me?\n",

      "It is cruel to press this matter so often upon me.—I never will have that man.\n",
      "The dreadful thing is, that comparing what he writes from his intelligencer of what is designed against me (though he seems not to know the threatened day) with what my aunt and Betty assure me of, there can be no hope for me, but that I must be Solmes's wife, if I stay here.\n",
      "I am really ill.\n",
      "I was in the ivy summer-house, and came out shivering with cold, as if aguishly affected.\n",
      "This was said by a cruel brother, and heard said by the dearer friends of one, for whom, but a few months ago, every body was apprehensive at the least blast of wind to which she exposed herself!\n",

      "O my dear Miss Howe!—what a sad, sad thing is the necessity, forced upon me, for all this preparation and contrivance!—But it is now too late!—But how!—Too late, did I say?—What a word is that!—What a dreadful thing, were I to repent, to find it to be too late to remedy the apprehended evil!\n",
      "It is a wonder, nevertheless, that he has not been seen by some of our tenants: for it is impossible that any disguise can hide the gracefulness of his figure.\n",
      "Besides, cold is a bracer, as my brother said yesterday.\n",
      "And indeed I am afraid of giving you my advice at all, or telling you what I should do in your case (supposing you will still refuse my offer; finding too what you have been brought or rather driven to without it); lest any evil should follow it: in which case, I should never forgive myself.\n",

      "That would be to put myself into the inconvenient situation of royalty: that is to say, out of the way of ever being told of my faults; of ever mending them: and in the way of making the sincerest and warmest friendship useless to me.\n",

My mother will have it, that you cannot now, with any decency, either see him, or correspond with him.
